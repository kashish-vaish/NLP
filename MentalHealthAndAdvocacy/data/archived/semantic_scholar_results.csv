1ec8a4c2bee24d99ef59b194313f458b7fd37e5d,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/1ec8a4c2bee24d99ef59b194313f458b7fd37e5d,Information for CAMHS patients about tribunals,"Thomas et al1 discussed the legal authority for detention of an 8-year-old child. The patient exercised his right of appeal with assistance from a solicitor and an independent mental health advocate and solicitor. The authors conclude that all clinicians working in child and adolescent services require knowledge of the law in relation to treatment of mental disorders in children. 
 
We consider it equally important that any detained children and adolescents have access to information about the process of a mental health tribunal hearing to ensure they are able to participate fully but also in the least distressing way. All information for patients about the procedure at a tribunal hearing – available via the Royal College of Psychiatrists2 or the First-tier Tribunal (Mental Health) website (www.gov.uk/mental-health-tribunal/what-happens-at-the-hearing) – is aimed at adult patients. 
 
To ensure developmentally appropriate information, we worked with a focus group of young people on a child and adolescent mental health service (CAMHS) in-patient unit and composed a suitable leaflet. The final version has been approved by the First-tier Tribunal (Mental Health) CAMHS panel lead judge and also by the Royal College of Psychiatrists' CAMHS Faculty lead. The leaflet is available on the College website (www.rcpsych.ac.uk/pdf/CAMHS%20GUide%20to%20Mental%20Health%20Tribunals%20Feb%202016.pdf). 
 
We hope that this information will be of benefit to detained young people such as the child in the case report.",2016,True,"{'url': 'https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/6A5675513666ADFA66C2A48AA677B9D9/S2056469400001704a.pdf/div-class-title-information-for-camhs-patients-about-tribunals-div.pdf', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBYNCND', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1192/pb.40.2.106a?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1192/pb.40.2.106a, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.
