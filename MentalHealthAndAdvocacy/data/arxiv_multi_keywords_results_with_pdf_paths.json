    "abstract": "Background: Depression is a common mental disorder with societal and economic\nburden. Current diagnosis relies on self-reports and assessment scales, which\nhave reliability issues. Objective approaches are needed for diagnosing\ndepression. Objective: Evaluate the potential of GPT technology in diagnosing\ndepression. Assess its ability to simulate individuals with depression and\ninvestigate the influence of depression scales. Methods: Three\ndepression-related assessment tools (HAMD-17, SDS, GDS-15) were used. Two\nexperiments simulated GPT responses to normal individuals and individuals with\ndepression. Compare GPT's responses with expected results, assess its\nunderstanding of depressive symptoms, and performance differences under\ndifferent conditions. Results: GPT's performance in depression assessment was\nevaluated. It aligned with scoring criteria for both individuals with\ndepression and normal individuals. Some performance differences were observed\nbased on depression severity. GPT performed better on scales with higher\nsensitivity. Conclusion: GPT accurately simulates individuals with depression\nand normal individuals during depression-related assessments. Deviations occur\nwhen simulating different degrees of depression, limiting understanding of mild\nand moderate cases. GPT performs better on scales with higher sensitivity,\nindicating potential for developing more effective depression scales. GPT has\nimportant potential in depression assessment, supporting clinicians and\npatients.",

    "abstract": "Depression is a common mental disorder that causes people to experience\ndepressed mood, loss of interest or pleasure, feelings of guilt or low\nself-worth. Traditional clinical depression diagnosis methods are subjective\nand time consuming. Since depression can be reflected by human facial\nexpressions, We propose a non-verbal facial behavior-based automatic depression\nclassification approach. In this paper, both short-term behavior-based and\nclip-based depression classification are constructed. The final clip-level\ndecision of short-term behavior-based depression detection is yielded by\naveraging the predictions of all short-term behaviors while we modelling\nbehaviors contained in all frames based on two Gaussian Mixture Models. To\nevaluate the proposed approaches, we select a gender balanced subset from AVEC\n2019 depression corpus containing 30 participants. The experimental results\nshow that our method achieved more than 75% depression classification accuracy,\nwhere both GMM-based clip-level depression modelling and rank pooling-based\nshort-term depression behavior modelling achieved at least 70% classification\naccuracy. The result indicates that our approach can leverage complementary\ninformation from both systems to achieve promising depression predictions from\nfacial behaviors.",

    "abstract": "Video-based automatic depression analysis provides a fast, objective and\nrepeatable self-assessment solution, which has been widely developed in recent\nyears. While depression clues may be reflected by human facial behaviours of\nvarious temporal scales, most existing approaches either focused on modelling\ndepression from short-term or video-level facial behaviours. In this sense, we\npropose a two-stage framework that models depression severity from multi-scale\nshort-term and video-level facial behaviours. The short-term depressive\nbehaviour modelling stage first deep learns depression-related facial\nbehavioural features from multiple short temporal scales, where a Depression\nFeature Enhancement (DFE) module is proposed to enhance the depression-related\nclues for all temporal scales and remove non-depression noises. Then, the\nvideo-level depressive behaviour modelling stage proposes two novel graph\nencoding strategies, i.e., Sequential Graph Representation (SEG) and Spectral\nGraph Representation (SPG), to re-encode all short-term features of the target\nvideo into a video-level graph representation, summarizing depression-related\nmulti-scale video-level temporal information. As a result, the produced graph\nrepresentations predict depression severity using both short-term and long-term\nfacial beahviour patterns. The experimental results on AVEC 2013 and AVEC 2014\ndatasets show that the proposed DFE module constantly enhanced the depression\nseverity estimation performance for various CNN models while the SPG is\nsuperior than other video-level modelling methods. More importantly, the result\nachieved for the proposed two-stage framework shows its promising and solid\nperformance compared to widely-used one-stage modelling approaches.",

    "abstract": "Depression, a highly prevalent mental illness, affects over 280 million\nindividuals worldwide. Early detection and timely intervention are crucial for\npromoting remission, preventing relapse, and alleviating the emotional and\nfinancial burdens associated with depression. However, patients with depression\noften go undiagnosed in the primary care setting. Unlike many physiological\nillnesses, depression lacks objective indicators for recognizing depression\nrisk, and existing methods for depression risk recognition are time-consuming\nand often encounter a shortage of trained medical professionals. The\ncorrelation between gait and depression risk has been empirically established.\nGait can serve as a promising objective biomarker, offering the advantage of\nefficient and convenient data collection. However, current methods for\nrecognizing depression risk based on gait have only been validated on small,\nprivate datasets, lacking large-scale publicly available datasets for research\npurposes. Additionally, these methods are primarily limited to hand-crafted\napproaches. Gait is a complex form of motion, and hand-crafted gait features\noften only capture a fraction of the intricate associations between gait and\ndepression risk. Therefore, this study first constructs a large-scale gait\ndatabase, encompassing over 1,200 individuals, 40,000 gait sequences, and\ncovering six perspectives and three types of attire. Two commonly used\npsychological scales are provided as depression risk annotations. Subsequently,\na deep learning-based depression risk recognition model is proposed, overcoming\nthe limitations of hand-crafted approaches. Through experiments conducted on\nthe constructed large-scale database, the effectiveness of the proposed method\nis validated, and numerous instructive insights are presented in the paper,\nhighlighting the significant potential of gait-based depression risk\nrecognition.",

Individuals with depression may exhibit changes in\nspeech, such as slower speech rate, longer pauses, reduced pitch variability,\nand decreased overall speech fluency. Despite the growing use of machine\nlearning in diagnosing depression, there is a lack of studies addressing the\nissue of relapse. Furthermore, previous research on relapse prediction has\nprimarily focused on clinical variables and has not taken into account other\nfactors such as verbal and non-verbal cues. Another major challenge in\ndepression relapse research is the scarcity of publicly available datasets. To\novercome these issues, we propose a one-shot learning framework for detecting\ndepression relapse from speech. We define depression relapse as the similarity\nbetween the speech audio and textual encoding of a subject and that of a\ndepressed individual.

The\ndepression prediction task is jointly optimized with two auxiliary anomaly\nranking tasks, including contrastive one-class feature ranking and deviation\nranking. The auxiliary tasks address two key challenges of the problem: 1) the\nhigh within class variance of depression samples: they enable the learning of\nrepresentations that are robust to highly variant in-class distribution of the\ndepression samples; and 2) the small labeled data volume: they significantly\nenhance the sample efficiency of the prediction model, which reduces the\nreliance on large depression-labeled datasets that are difficult to collect in\npractice.

This article tackles two central\nmethodological challenges in understanding the micro-level mechanisms between\ndepressive symptoms and social interactions. The first contribution is the\napplication of novel data collection strategies that employ RFID sensors to\nrecord behavioral data on interpersonal interaction, which we combine with\nself-reported depressive symptoms and sociometric data on friendship relations.\nThe second contribution is the analysis of these data with statistical social\nnetwork methodology that allows testing hypotheses on the duration of\ninteractions between pairs of individuals.

We conclude that depressive symptoms\nare associated with (1) spending less time in social interaction, (2) spending\ntime with similarly depressed others, (3) spending time in pair-wise\ninteractions rather than group interactions, and with (4) spending more time\nwith reciprocal friends (but not with unilaterally perceived friends).

This report is all about how our team, Mason-NLP, participated\nin this subtask, which involved identifying sentences related to different\ndepression symptoms. We used a deep learning approach that incorporated\nMentalBERT, RoBERTa, and LSTM. Despite our efforts, the evaluation results were\nlower than expected, underscoring the challenges inherent in ranking sentences\nfrom an extensive dataset about depression, which necessitates both appropriate\nmethodological choices and significant computational resources. We anticipate\nthat future iterations of this shared task will yield improved results as our\nunderstanding and techniques evolve.",

    "abstract": "Speech based depression classification has gained immense popularity over the\nrecent years. However, most of the classification studies have focused on\nbinary classification to distinguish depressed subjects from non-depressed\nsubjects. In this paper, we formulate the depression classification task as a\nseverity level classification problem to provide more granularity to the\nclassification outcomes. We use articulatory coordination features (ACFs)\ndeveloped to capture the changes of neuromotor coordination that happens as a\nresult of psychomotor slowing, a necessary feature of Major Depressive\nDisorder. The ACFs derived from the vocal tract variables (TVs) are used to\ntrain a dilated Convolutional Neural Network based depression classification\nmodel to obtain segment-level predictions. Then, we propose a Recurrent Neural\nNetwork based approach to obtain session-level predictions from segment-level\npredictions. We show that strengths of the segment-wise classifier are\namplified when a session-wise classifier is trained on embeddings obtained from\nit. The model trained on ACFs derived from TVs show relative improvement of\n27.47% in Unweighted Average Recall (UAR) at the session-level classification\ntask, compared to the ACFs derived from Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients\n(MFCCs).",

Towards this end, using structural MRI and phenotypic data from the\nAutism Brain Imaging Data Exchange II (ABIDE II) repository, we specifically\nexamined the pattern of relationship regional grey matter volume (rGMV) has\nwith comorbid depression and autism severity within regions of a priori\ninterest in adults with ASD (n = 44). The severity of comorbid depression\ncorrelated negatively with the rGMV of the right thalamus. Additionally, a\nsignificant interaction was evident between the severity of comorbid depression\nand core ASD symptoms towards explaining the rGMV in the left cerebellum crus\nII. The whole-brain regional rGMV differences between ASD and typically\ndeveloped (TD, n = 39) adults remained inconclusive. The results further the\nunderstanding of the neurobiological underpinnings of comorbid depression in\nadults with ASD and are relevant in exploring structural neuroimaging-based\nbiomarkers in the same cohort.",

We used a sample of 28,749 Facebook\nusers to build a language prediction model of survey-reported depression and\nanxiety, and validated it on Twitter on a sample of 887 users who had taken\nanxiety and depression surveys. We then applied it to a different set of 4,132\nTwitter users to impute language-based depression and anxiety labels, and\nextracted interpretable features of posted and profile pictures to uncover the\nassociations with users' depression and anxiety, controlling for demographics.\nFor depression, we find that profile pictures suppress positive emotions rather\nthan display more negative emotions, likely because of social media\nself-presentation biases. They also tend to show the single face of the user\n(rather than show her in groups of friends), marking increased focus on the\nself, emblematic for depression. Posted images are dominated by grayscale and\nlow aesthetic cohesion across a variety of image features. Profile images of\nanxious users are similarly marked by grayscale and low aesthetic cohesion, but\nless so than those of depressed users. Finally, we show that image features can\nbe used to predict depression and anxiety, and that multitask learning that\nincludes a joint modeling of demographics improves prediction performance.\nOverall, we find that the image attributes that mark depression and anxiety\noffer a rich lens into these conditions largely congruent with the\npsychological literature, and that images on Twitter allow inferences about the\nmental health status of users.",

PHC is the first point of contact for most people with\ndepression, but about 25% of diagnoses made by PHC physicians are inaccurate.\nMany other barriers also hinder depression detection and treatment in PHC.\nArtificial intelligence (AI) may help reduce depression misdiagnosis in PHC and\nimprove overall diagnosis and treatment outcomes. Telehealth consultations\noften have video issues, such as poor connectivity or dropped calls. Audio-only\ntelehealth is often more practical for lower-income patients who may lack\nstable internet connections. Thus, our study focused on using audio data to\npredict depression risk. The objectives were to: 1) Collect audio data from 24\npeople (12 with depression and 12 without mental health or major health\ncondition diagnoses); 2) Build a machine learning model to predict depression\nrisk. TPOT, an autoML tool, was used to select the best machine learning\nalgorithm, which was the K-nearest neighbors classifier. The selected model had\nhigh performance in classifying depression risk (Precision: 0.98, Recall: 0.93,\nF1-Score: 0.96). These findings may lead to a range of tools to help screen for\nand treat depression.

Heart rate\nvariability (HRV) is a rich source of information for studying the dynamics of\nthis relation. Disturbed heart dynamics in depression seriously increases\nmortality risk. Technical sciences help improve early detection and monitoring\nand offer more accurate management of treatment.

This work is a\ncross-sectional analysis with methodological commentary of application of\nnonlinear measures of HRV related to depression.

We scrutinized chosen\npublications and methodologically analyzed and compared them. Results:\nSixty-seven publications on the connection of HRV measures and depression\nmeeting our inclusion criteria are selected. The effectiveness of the applied\nmethods of electrocardiogram (ECG) analysis are compared and discussed in the\nlight of detection and prevention of depression-related cardiac diseases.\nConclusions: It is clear that aberrated ANS dynamics can be detected via ECG\nanalysis, where nonlinear measures show to be more sensitive and accurate than\nstandard time and spectral ones.

To verify this\nhypothesis, we employ a binary discrete-time associative memory model which\nconsists of excitatory and inhibitory neurons. It is known that the\nexcitatory-inhibitory balance controls an overall activity of the network. The\nsynaptic depression might incorporate an activity control mechanism. Using a\nmean-field theory and computer simulations, we find that the basins of\nattraction are enlarged whereas the storage capacity does not change.\nFurthermore, the excitatory-inhibitory balance and the synaptic depression work\ncooperatively. This result suggests that the synaptic depression works to\nimprove an error-correcting ability in cortical circuits.",

    "abstract": "Competitive neural networks are often used to model the dynamics of\nperceptual bistability. Switching between percepts can occur through\nfluctuations and/or a slow adaptive process. Here, we analyze switching\nstatistics in competitive networks with short term synaptic depression and\nnoise. We start by analyzing a ring model that yields spatially structured\nsolutions and complement this with a study of a space-free network whose\npopulations are coupled with mutual inhibition. Dominance times arising from\ndepression driven switching can be approximated using a separation of\ntimescales in the ring and space-free model. For purely noise-driven switching,\nwe use energy arguments to justify how dominance times are exponentially\nrelated to input strength. We also show that a combination of depression and\nnoise generates realistic distributions of dominance times. Unimodal functions\nof dominance times are more easily differentiated from one another using\nBayesian sampling, suggesting synaptic depression induced switching transfers\nmore information about stimuli than noise-driven switching. Finally, we analyze\na competitive network model of perceptual tristability, showing depression\ngenerates a memory of previous percepts based on the ordering of percepts.",

    "abstract": "Depression is debilitating, and not uncommon. Indeed, studies of excessive\nsocial media users show correlations with depression, ADHD, and other mental\nhealth concerns. Given that there is a large number of people with excessive\nsocial media usage, then there is a significant population of potentially\nundiagnosed users and posts that they create. In this paper, we propose a\ndepression severity detection system using a semi-supervised learning technique\nto predict if a post is from a user who is experiencing severe, moderate, or\nlow (non-diagnostic) levels of depression.

Recently,\nthese low amplitudes have been attributed to the presence of a strong magnetic\nfield in the stellar core of those stars.\n  We intend to study the properties of depressed modes in evolved stars, which\nis a necessary condition before concluding on the physical nature of the\nmechanism responsible for the reduction of the dipole mode amplitudes.\n  We perform a thorough characterization of the global seismic parameters of\ndepressed dipole modes and show that these modes have a mixed character. The\nobservation of stars showing dipole mixed modes that are depressed is\nespecially useful for deriving model-independent conclusions on the dipole mode\ndamping.\n  Observations prove that depressed dipole modes in red giants are not pure\npressure modes but mixed modes. This result invalidates the hypothesis that the\ndepressed dipole modes result from the suppression of the oscillation in the\nradiative core of the stars. Observations also show that, except for the\nvisibility, the seismic properties of the stars with depressed modes are\nequivalent to those of normal stars.\n  The mixed nature of the depressed modes in red giants and their unperturbed\nglobal seismic parameters carry strong constraints on the physical mechanism\nresponsible for the damping of the oscillation in the core. This mechanism is\nable to damp the oscillation in the core but cannot fully suppress it.\nMoreover, it cannot modify the radiative cavity probed by the gravity component\nof the mixed modes. The recent mechanism involving high magnetic field proposed\nfor explaining depressed modes is not compliant with the observations and\ncannot be used to infer the strength and the prevalence of high magnetic fields\nin red giants.",

Measuring\nthe Wilson depression is important for understanding the geometry of sunspots.\nCurrent methods suffer from systematic effects or need to make assumptions on\nthe geometry of the magnetic field.

In\naddition, we apply the method to Hinode observations of a sunspot. The derived\nWilson depression (about 600 km) is consistent with results typically obtained\nfrom the Wilson effect.

We derived the Wilson depression for each spot\nusing both, a recently developed method that is based on minimizing the\ndivergence of the magnetic field, and an approach developed earlier that\nenforces an equilibrium between the gas pressure and the magnetic pressure\ninside the spot and the gas pressure in the quiet Sun, thus neglecting the\ninfluence of the curvature force. We then performed a statistical analysis by\ncomparing the Wilson depression resulting from the two techniques with each\nother and by relating them to various parameters of the sunspots, such as their\nsize or the strength of the magnetic field.\n  Results: We find that the Wilson depression becomes larger for spots with a\nstronger magnetic field, but not as much as one would expect from the increased\nmagnetic pressure. This suggests that the curvature integral provides an\nimportant contribution to the Wilson depression, particularly for spots with a\nweak magnetic field.

However, existing studies of depression detection\nbased on machine learning still leave relatively low classification\nperformance, suggesting that there is significant improvement potential for\nimprovement in their feature engineering. In this paper, we manually build a\nlarge dataset on Sina Weibo (a leading OSN with the largest number of active\nusers in the Chinese community), namely Weibo User Depression Detection Dataset\n(WU3D). It includes more than 20,000 normal users and more than 10,000\ndepressed users, both of which are manually labeled and rechecked by\nprofessionals. By analyzing the user's text, social behavior, and posted\npictures, ten statistical features are concluded and proposed. In the meantime,\ntext-based word features are extracted using the popular pretrained model\nXLNet. Moreover, a novel deep neural network classification model, i.e.\nFusionNet (FN), is proposed and simultaneously trained with the above-extracted\nfeatures, which are seen as multiple classification tasks. The experimental\nresults show that FusionNet achieves the highest F1-Score of 0.9772 on the test\ndataset.

The effectiveness of the\nproposed method is demonstrated on two datasets - DAIC-WOZ (English) and\nCONVERGE (Mandarin), with three feature sets (Mel-spectrograms, raw-audio\nsignals, and the last-hidden-state of Wav2vec2.0), using a modified DepAudioNet\nmodel.

Analysis of the class-separability measure (J-ratio) of\nthe hidden states of the DepAudioNet model shows that when adversarial learning\nis applied, the backend model loses some speaker-discriminability while it\nimproves depression-discriminability.

In this work,\nwe tackle the task of automatically identifying depression from multi-modal\ndata and introduce a sub-attention mechanism for linking heterogeneous\ninformation while leveraging Convolutional Bidirectional LSTM as our backbone.\nTo validate this idea, we conduct extensive experiments on the public DAIC-WOZ\nbenchmark for depression assessment featuring different evaluation modes and\ntaking gender-specific biases into account. The proposed model yields effective\nresults with 0.89 precision and 0.70 F1-score in detecting major depression and\n4.92 MAE in estimating the severity. Our attention-based fusion module\nconsistently outperforms conventional late fusion approaches and achieves\ncompetitive performance compared to the previously published depression\nestimation frameworks, while learning to diagnose the disorder end-to-end and\nrelying on far fewer preprocessing steps.",

Leaving aside the longcovid cognitive (e.g.,\ndifficulty in concentration) and bodily (e.g., loss of smell) effects, the\nshort-term covid effects on mental health were a significant increase in\nanxiety and depressive symptoms. The aim of this study is to use a new tool,\nthe online handwriting and drawing analysis, to discriminate between healthy\nindividuals and depressed patients. To this aim, patients with clinical\ndepression (n = 14), individuals with high sub-clinical (diagnosed by a test\nrather than a doctor) depressive traits (n = 15) and healthy individuals (n =\n20) were recruited and asked to perform four online drawing /handwriting tasks\nusing a digitizing tablet and a special writing device. From the raw collected\nonline data, seventeen drawing/writing features (categorized into five\ncategories) were extracted, and compared among the three groups of the involved\nparticipants, through ANOVA repeated measures analyses.

Secondly,We conducted an\nextensive analysis of this dataset to investigate the characteristic of\nCOVID-19 patients with a higher risk of depression. Thirdly, we proposed a deep\nneural network for early prediction of depression risk.

To detect morphological temporal\nchanges, we compared pre- and post-perihelion high-resolution (pixel scale of\n0.07-1.75 m) OSIRIS images of the two depressions. We quantified the changes\nusing the dynamic heights and the gravitational slopes calculated from the\nDigital Terrain Model (DTM) of the studied area using the ArcGIS software\nbefore and after perihelion. Our comparative morphometrical analysis allowed us\nto detect and quantify the temporal changes that occurred in two depressions of\nthe Ash region during the last perihelion passage. We find that the two\ndepressions grew by several meters. The area of the smallest depression\n(structure I) increased by 90+/-20%, with two preferential growths: one close\nto the cliff associated with the apparition of new boulders at its foot, and a\nsecond one on the opposite side of the cliff. The largest depression (structure\nII) grew in all directions, increasing in area by 20+/-5%, and no new deposits\nhave been detected. We interpreted these two depression changes as being driven\nby the sublimation of ices, which explains their global growth and which can\nalso trigger landslides. The deposits associated with depression II reveal a\nstair-like topography, indicating that they have accumulated during several\nsuccessive landslides from different perihelion passages. Overall, these\nobservations bring additional evidence of complex active processes and\nreshaping events occurring on short timescales, such as depression growth and\nlandslides, and on longer timescales, such as cliff retreat.",

To address these concerns, prior\nwork has used privacy-preserving speech features.

Furthermore, prior work relies on a centralized approach to\nsupport continuous model updates, posing privacy risks. This paper proposes to\nuse Federated Learning (FL) to enable decentralized, privacy-preserving speech\nanalysis to assess depression. Using an existing dataset (DAIC-WOZ), we show\nthat FL models enable a robust assessment of depression with only 4--6%\naccuracy loss compared to a centralized approach. These models also outperform\nprior work using the same dataset. Furthermore, the FL models have short\ninference latency and small memory footprints while being energy-efficient.\nThese models, thus, can be deployed on mobile devices for real-time,\ncontinuous, and privacy-preserving depression assessment at scale.",

    "abstract": "Heuristics used for solving hard real-time search problems have regions with\ndepressions. Such regions are bounded areas of the search space in which the\nheuristic function is inaccurate compared to the actual cost to reach a\nsolution. Early real-time search algorithms, like LRTA*, easily become trapped\nin those regions since the heuristic values of their states may need to be\nupdated multiple times, which results in costly solutions. State-of-the-art\nreal-time search algorithms, like LSS-LRTA* or LRTA*(k), improve LRTA*s\nmechanism to update the heuristic, resulting in improved performance. Those\nalgorithms, however, do not guide search towards avoiding depressed regions.\nThis paper presents depression avoidance, a simple real-time search principle\nto guide search towards avoiding states that have been marked as part of a\nheuristic depression. We propose two ways in which depression avoidance can be\nimplemented: mark-and-avoid and move-to-border. We implement these strategies\non top of LSS-LRTA* and RTAA*, producing 4 new real-time heuristic search\nalgorithms: aLSS-LRTA*, daLSS-LRTA*, aRTAA*, and daRTAA*. When the objective is\nto find a single solution by running the real-time search algorithm once, we\nshow that daLSS-LRTA* and daRTAA* outperform their predecessors sometimes by\none order of magnitude. Of the four new algorithms, daRTAA* produces the best\nsolutions given a fixed deadline on the average time allowed per planning\nepisode. We prove all our algorithms have good theoretical properties: in\nfinite search spaces, they find a solution if one exists, and converge to an\noptimal after a number of trials.",

    "abstract": "Social media has recently emerged as a premier method to disseminate\ninformation online. Through these online networks, tens of millions of\nindividuals communicate their thoughts, personal experiences, and social\nideals. We therefore explore the potential of social media to predict, even\nprior to onset, Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) in online personas. We employ a\ncrowdsourced method to compile a list of Twitter users who profess to being\ndiagnosed with depression. Using up to a year of prior social media postings,\nwe utilize a Bag of Words approach to quantify each tweet. Lastly, we leverage\nseveral statistical classifiers to provide estimates to the risk of depression.\nOur work posits a new methodology for constructing our classifier by treating\nsocial as a text-classification problem, rather than a behavioral one on social\nmedia platforms. By using a corpus of 2.5M tweets, we achieved an 81% accuracy\nrate in classification, with a precision score of .86. We believe that this\nmethod may be helpful in developing tools that estimate the risk of an\nindividual being depressed, can be employed by physicians, concerned\nindividuals, and healthcare agencies to aid in diagnosis, even possibly\nenabling those suffering from depression to be more proactive about recovering\nfrom their mental health.",

    "abstract": "Psychomotor retardation associated with depression has been linked with\ntangible differences in vowel production. This paper investigates a\nknowledge-driven machine learning (ML) method that integrates spectrotemporal\ninformation of speech at the vowel-level to identify the depression. Low-level\nspeech descriptors are learned by a convolutional neural network (CNN) that is\ntrained for vowel classification. The temporal evolution of those low-level\ndescriptors is modeled at the high-level within and across utterances via a\nlong short-term memory (LSTM) model that takes the final depression decision. A\nmodified version of the Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME)\nis further used to identify the impact of the low-level spectrotemporal vowel\nvariation on the decisions and observe the high-level temporal change of the\ndepression likelihood. The proposed method outperforms baselines that model the\nspectrotemporal information in speech without integrating the vowel-based\ninformation, as well as ML models trained with conventional prosodic and\nspectrotemporal features. The conducted explainability analysis indicates that\nspectrotemporal information corresponding to non-vowel segments less important\nthan the vowel-based information.

The depression appears as\ncentered on the neutral calcium resonance line at 4227A and leads to nearby\nfeatures being weaker by about two orders of magnitude than predicted. We\nconsider a variety of possible causes for the depression including temperature,\ngravity, metallicity, dust, damping constants, and atmospheric stratification.\nWe also consider relevant molecular opacities which might be the cause\nidentifying AlH, SiH, and NaH in the spectral region. However, none of these\nsolutions are satisfactory. In the absence of a more accurate determination of\nthe broadening of the calcium line perturbed by molecular hydrogen, we find a\npromising empirical fit using a modified Lorentzian line profile for the\ncalcium resonance line. Such fits provide a simplistic line-broadening\ndescription for this calcium resonance line and potentially other un-modelled\nresonance lines in cool high-pressure atmospheres. Thus we claim the most\nplausible cause of the blue depression in the optical spectra of M dwarfs is a\nlack of appropriate treatment of line broadening for atomic calcium.

    "abstract": "Depressions (or pits) are low areas within a digital elevation model that are\nsurrounded by higher terrain, with no outlet to lower areas. Filling them so\nthey are level, as fluid would fill them if the terrain were impermeable, is\noften necessary in preprocessing DEMs. The depression-filling algorithm\npresented here---called Priority-Flood---unifies and improves on the work of a\nnumber of previous authors who have published similar algorithms. The algorithm\noperates by flooding DEMs inwards from their edges using a priority queue to\ndetermine the next cell to be flooded. The resultant DEM has no depressions or\ndigital dams: every cell is guaranteed to drain. The algorithm is optimal for\nboth integer and floating-point data, working in O(n) and O(n lg n) time,\nrespectively. It is shown that by using a plain queue to fill depressions once\nthey have been found, an O(m lg m) time-complexity can be achieved, where m\ndoes not exceed the number of cells n. This is the lowest time complexity of\nany known floating-point depression-filling algorithm. In testing, this\nimproved variation of the algorithm performed up to 37% faster than the\noriginal. Additionally, a parallel version of an older, but widely-used\ndepression-filling algorithm required six parallel processors to achieve a\nrun-time on par with what the newer algorithm's improved variation took on a\nsingle processor. The Priority-Flood Algorithm is simple to understand and\nimplement: the included pseudocode is only 20 lines and the included C++\nreference implementation is under a hundred lines. The algorithm can work on\nirregular meshes as well as 4-, 6-, 8-, and n-connected grids. It can also be\nadapted to label watersheds and determine flow directions through either\nincremental elevation changes or depression carving. In the case of incremental\nelevation changes, the algorithm includes safety checks not present in prior\nworks.",

It has become a global major public health problem\nand attracts attention from various research fields. Traditionally, the\ndiagnosis of depression is formulated through semi-structured interviews and\nsupplementary questionnaires, which makes the diagnosis heavily relying on\nphysicians experience and is subject to bias. Mental health monitoring and\ncloud-based remote diagnosis can be implemented through an automated depression\ndiagnosis system. In this article, we propose an attention-based multimodality\nspeech and text representation for depression prediction. Our model is trained\nto estimate the depression severity of participants using the Distress Analysis\nInterview Corpus-Wizard of Oz (DAIC-WOZ) dataset. For the audio modality, we\nuse the collaborative voice analysis repository (COVAREP) features provided by\nthe dataset and employ a Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory Network (Bi-LSTM)\nfollowed by a Time-distributed Convolutional Neural Network (T-CNN). For the\ntext modality, we use global vectors for word representation (GloVe) to perform\nword embeddings and the embeddings are fed into the Bi-LSTM network. Results\nshow that both audio and text models perform well on the depression severity\nestimation task, with best sequence level F1 score of 0.9870 and patient-level\nF1 score of 0.9074 for the audio model over five classes (healthy, mild,\nmoderate, moderately severe, and severe), as well as sequence level F1 score of\n0.9709 and patient-level F1 score of 0.9245 for the text model over five\nclasses. Results are similar for the multimodality fused model, with the\nhighest F1 score of 0.9580 on the patient-level depression detection task over\nfive classes. Experiments show statistically significant improvements over\nprevious works.",

    "abstract": "Depression is a widespread mental health issue, affecting an estimated 3.8%\nof the global population. It is also one of the main contributors to disability\nworldwide. Recently it is becoming popular for individuals to use social media\nplatforms (e.g., Reddit) to express their difficulties and health issues (e.g.,\ndepression) and seek support from other users in online communities. It opens\ngreat opportunities to automatically identify social media users with\ndepression by parsing millions of posts for potential interventions. Deep\nlearning methods have begun to dominate in the field of machine learning and\nnatural language processing (NLP) because of their ease of use, efficient\nprocessing, and state-of-the-art results on many NLP tasks. In this work, we\npropose a hybrid deep learning model which combines a pretrained sentence BERT\n(SBERT) and convolutional neural network (CNN) to detect individuals with\ndepression with their Reddit posts. The sentence BERT is used to learn the\nmeaningful representation of semantic information in each post. CNN enables the\nfurther transformation of those embeddings and the temporal identification of\nbehavioral patterns of users. We trained and evaluated the model performance to\nidentify Reddit users with depression by utilizing the Self-reported Mental\nHealth Diagnoses (SMHD) data. The hybrid deep learning model achieved an\naccuracy of 0.86 and an F1 score of 0.86 and outperformed the state-of-the-art\ndocumented result (F1 score of 0.79) by other machine learning models in the\nliterature. The results show the feasibility of the hybrid model to identify\nindividuals with depression. Although the hybrid model is validated to detect\ndepression with Reddit posts, it can be easily tuned and applied to other text\nclassification tasks and different clinical applications.",

The gait cadence of faster\nsteps (75th percentile) over a long-term period has a significant negative\nassociation with the depression symptom severity of this period in both\ndatasets. Daily-life gait features could significantly improve the goodness of\nfit of evaluating depression severity relative to laboratory gait patterns and\ndemographics, which was assessed by likelihood-ratio tests in both datasets.\nThis study indicated that the significant links between daily-life walking\ncharacteristics and depression symptom severity could be captured by both\nwearable devices and mobile phones.

In addition, we find that the effect on the eclipse ingress/egress\ntimes becomes more profound for lower orbital inclinations.

When the relative velocity is sufficiently\nsmall, the periodic pattern reduces to a periodic array of topological solitons\nas kinks of relative phase. According to our variational and numerical\nanalyses, the soliton solution is well characterized by the soliton width and\ndensity depression. We demonstrate the dependence of the depression and width\non the Rabi frequency and the coupling constant of inter-component\ndensity-density interactions. The periodic pattern of the relative phase\ntransforms continuously from a soliton array to a sinusoidal pattern as the\nperiod becomes smaller than the soliton width. These patterns become unstable\nwhen the localized relative velocity exceeds a critical value.

    "abstract": "Depression is a leading cause of death worldwide, and the diagnosis of\ndepression is nontrivial. Multimodal learning is a popular solution for\nautomatic diagnosis of depression, and the existing works suffer two main\ndrawbacks: 1) the high-order interactions between different modalities can not\nbe well exploited; and 2) interpretability of the models are weak. To remedy\nthese drawbacks, we propose a multimodal multi-order factor fusion (MMFF)\nmethod. Our method can well exploit the high-order interactions between\ndifferent modalities by extracting and assembling modality factors under the\nguide of a shared latent proxy. We conduct extensive experiments on two recent\nand popular datasets, E-DAIC-WOZ and CMDC, and the results show that our method\nachieve significantly better performance compared with other existing\napproaches. Besides, by analyzing the process of factor assembly, our model can\nintuitively show the contribution of each factor. This helps us understand the\nfusion mechanism.",

These two objects are\noriginally selected as i'-dropouts (i'-z' > 1.5) showing an interesting\nphotometric property, the ``NB921 depression''. The NB921-band (centered at\n9196A) magnitude is significantly depressed with respect to the z'-band\nmagnitude. The optical spectra of these two objects exhibit asymmetric\nemission-lines at lambda_obs ~ 8540A and ~ 8560A, suggesting that these objects\nare Ly_alpha emitters at z~6. The rest-frame equivalent widths of the Ly_alpha\nemission of the two objects are 94A and 236A; the latter one is the Ly_alpha\nemitter with the largest Ly_alpha equivalent width at z > 6 ever\nspectroscopically confirmed. The spectroscopically measured Ly_alpha fluxes of\nthese two objects are consistent with the interpretation that the NB921\ndepression is caused by the contribution of the strong Ly_alpha emission to the\nz'-band flux. Most of the NB921-depressed i'-dropout objects are thought to be\nstrong Ly_alpha emitters at 6.0 < z < 6.5; Galactic L and T dwarfs and\nNB921-dropout galaxies at z > 6.6 do not dominate the NB921-depressed\ni'-dropout sample. Thus the NB921-depression method is very useful for finding\nhigh-z Ly_alpha emitters with a large Ly_alpha equivalent width over a large\nredshift range, 6.0 < z < 6.5. Although the broadband-selected sample at z ~ 3\ncontains only a small fraction of objects with a Ly_alpha equivalent width\nlarger than 100A, the i'-dropout sample of the Subaru Deep Field contains a\nmuch larger fraction of such strong Ly_alpha emitters. This may imply a strong\nevolution of the Ly_alpha equivalent width from z > 6 to z ~ 3.",

It was observed that neurons with short-term\nfacilitating synapses form predominantly reciprocal pairwise connections, while\nneurons with short-term depressing synapses form unidirectional pairwise\nconnections. The cause of these structural differences in synaptic\nmicrocircuits is unknown. We propose that these connectivity motifs emerge from\nthe interactions between short-term synaptic dynamics (SD) and long-term\nspike-timing dependent plasticity (STDP). While the impact of STDP on SD was\nshown in vitro, the mutual interactions between STDP and SD in large networks\nare still the subject of intense research. We formulate a computational model\nby combining SD and STDP, which captures faithfully short- and long-term\ndependence on both spike times and frequency. As a proof of concept, we\nsimulate recurrent networks of spiking neurons with random initial connection\nefficacies and where synapses are either all short-term facilitating or all\ndepressing. For identical background inputs, and as a direct consequence of\ninternally generated activity, we find that networks with depressing synapses\nevolve unidirectional connectivity motifs, while networks with facilitating\nsynapses evolve reciprocal connectivity motifs. This holds for heterogeneous\nnetworks including both facilitating and depressing synapses.

    "abstract": "Recent studies show that depression can be partially reflected from human\nfacial attributes. Since facial attributes have various data structure and\ncarry different information, existing approaches fail to specifically consider\nthe optimal way to extract depression-related features from each of them, as\nwell as investigates the best fusion strategy. In this paper, we propose to\nextend Neural Architecture Search (NAS) technique for designing an optimal\nmodel for multiple facial attributes-based depression recognition, which can be\nefficiently and robustly implemented in a small dataset. Our approach first\nconducts a warmer up step to the feature extractor of each facial attribute,\naiming to largely reduce the search space and providing customized\narchitecture, where each feature extractor can be either a Convolution Neural\nNetworks (CNN) or Graph Neural Networks (GNN). Then, we conduct an end-to-end\narchitecture search for all feature extractors and the fusion network, allowing\nthe complementary depression cues to be optimally combined with less\nredundancy. The experimental results on AVEC 2016 dataset show that the model\nexplored by our approach achieves breakthrough performance with 27\\% and 30\\%\nRMSE and MAE improvements over the existing state-of-the-art. In light of these\nfindings, this paper provides solid evidences and a strong baseline for\napplying NAS to time-series data-based mental health analysis.",

Mental well-being scores and listening histories of 541\nLast.fm users were examined. Static and dynamic acoustic and emotion-related\nfeatures were extracted from each user's listening history and correlated with\ntheir mental well-being scores. Results revealed that individuals with greater\ndepression risk resort to higher dependency on music with greater\nrepetitiveness in their listening activity. Furthermore, the affinity of\ndepressed individuals towards music that can be perceived as sad was found to\nbe resistant to change over time.

The standard corpus is varied over time with expert opinion\nso as to improve the model's reliability. A psychologist ( with the patient's\npermission ) could leverage the application to assess the patient's depression\nstatus prior to counseling, which provides better insight into the mental\nhealth status of a patient. In addition, to the same, the psychologist could be\nreferred to cases of similar characteristics, which could in turn help in more\neffective treatment.

    "abstract": "All groups of people felt the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. This situation\ntriggers anxiety, which is bad for everyone. The government's role is very\ninfluential in solving these problems with its work program. It also has many\npros and cons that cause public anxiety. For that, it is necessary to detect\nanxiety to improve government programs that can increase public expectations.\nThis study applies machine learning to detecting anxiety based on social media\ncomments regarding government programs to deal with this pandemic. This concept\nwill adopt a sentiment analysis in detecting anxiety based on positive and\nnegative comments from netizens. The machine learning methods implemented\ninclude K-NN, Bernoulli, Decision Tree Classifier, Support Vector Classifier,\nRandom Forest, and XG-boost. The data sample used is the result of crawling\nYouTube comments. The data used amounted to 4862 comments consisting of\nnegative and positive data with 3211 and 1651. Negative data identify anxiety,\nwhile positive data identifies hope (not anxious). Machine learning is\nprocessed based on feature extraction of count-vectorization and TF-IDF. The\nresults showed that the sentiment data amounted to 3889 and 973 in testing, and\ntraining with the greatest accuracy was the random forest with feature\nextraction of vectorization count and TF-IDF of 84.99% and 82.63%,\nrespectively. The best precision test is K-NN, while the best recall is\nXG-Boost. Thus, Random Forest is the best accurate to detect someone's anxiety\nbased-on data from social media.",

    "abstract": "Math anxiety is a clinical pathology impairing cognitive processing in\nmath-related contexts. Originally thought to affect only inexperienced,\nlow-achieving students, recent investigations show how math anxiety is vastly\ndiffused even among high-performing learners. This review of data-informed\nstudies outlines math anxiety as a complex system that: (i) cripples\nwell-being, self-confidence and information processing on both conscious and\nsubconscious levels, (ii) can be transmitted by social interactions, like a\npathogen, and worsened by distorted perceptions, (iii) affects roughly 20% of\nstudents in 63 out of 64 worldwide educational systems but correlates weakly\nwith academic performance, and (iv) poses a concrete threat to students'\nwell-being, computational literacy and career prospects in science. These\npatterns underline the crucial need to go beyond performance for estimating\nmath anxiety. Recent advances with network psychometrics and cognitive network\nscience provide ideal frameworks for detecting, interpreting and intervening\nupon such clinical condition. Merging education research, psychology and data\nscience, the approaches reviewed here reconstruct psychological constructs as\ncomplex systems, represented either as multivariate correlation models (e.g.\ngraph exploratory analysis) or as cognitive networks of semantic/emotional\nassociations (e.g. free association networks or forma mentis networks). Not\nonly can these interconnected networks detect otherwise hidden levels of math\nanxiety but - more crucially - they can unveil the specific layout of\ninteracting factors, e.g. key sources and targets, behind math anxiety in a\ngiven cohort. As discussed here, these network approaches open concrete ways\nfor unveiling students' perceptions, emotions and mental well-being, and can\nenable future powerful data-informed interventions untangling math anxiety.",

    "abstract": "This paper explores a novel method for anxiety detection in older adults\nusing simple wristband sensors such as Electrodermal Activity (EDA) and\nPhotoplethysmogram (PPG) and a context-based feature. The proposed method for\nanxiety detection combines features from a single physiological signal with an\nexperimental context-based feature to improve the performance of the anxiety\ndetection model. The experimental data for this work is obtained from a\nyear-long experiment on 41 healthy older adults (26 females and 15 males) in\nthe age range 60-80 with mean age 73.36+-5.25 during a Trier Social Stress Test\n(TSST) protocol. The anxiety level ground truth was obtained from State-Trait\nAnxiety Inventory (STAI), which is regarded as the gold standard to measure\nperceived anxiety. EDA and Blood Volume Pulse (BVP) signals were recorded using\na wrist-worn EDA and PPG sensor respectively. 47 features were computed from\nEDA and BVP signal, out of which a final set of 24 significantly correlated\nfeatures were selected for analysis. The phases of the experimental study are\nencoded as unique integers to generate the context feature vector. A\ncombination of features from a single sensor with the context feature vector is\nused for training a machine learning model to distinguish between anxious and\nnot-anxious states. Results and analysis showed that the EDA and BVP machine\nlearning models that combined the context feature along with the physiological\nfeatures achieved 3.37% and 6.41% higher accuracy respectively than the models\nthat used only physiological features. Further, end-to-end processing of EDA\nand BVP signals was simulated for real-time anxiety level detection. This work\ndemonstrates the practicality of the proposed anxiety detection method in\nfacilitating long-term monitoring of anxiety in older adults using low-cost\nconsumer devices.",

    "abstract": "Normal anxiety is considered an adaptive response to the possible presence of\ndanger, but is susceptible to dysregulation. Anxiety disorders are prevalent at\nhigh frequency in contemporary human societies, yet impose substantial\ndisability upon their sufferers. This raises a puzzle: why has evolution left\nus vulnerable to anxiety disorders? We develop a signal detection model in\nwhich individuals must learn how to calibrate their anxiety responses: they\nneed to learn which cues indicate danger in the environment. We derive the\noptimal strategy for doing so, and find that individuals face an inevitable\nexploration-exploitation tradeoff between obtaining a better estimate of the\nlevel of risk on one hand, and maximizing current payoffs on the other. Because\nof this tradeoff, a subset of the population can become trapped in a state of\nself-perpetuating over-sensitivity to threatening stimuli, even when\nindividuals learn optimally. This phenomenon arises because when individuals\nbecome too cautious, they stop sampling the environment and fail to correct\ntheir misperceptions, whereas when individuals become too careless they\ncontinue to sample the environment and soon discover their mistakes. Thus,\nover-sensitivity to threats becomes common whereas under-sensitivity becomes\nrare. We suggest that this process may be involved in the development of\nexcessive anxiety in humans.",

This study\nexplores the effectiveness of supportive psychotherapy, specifically\nCognitive-Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia (CBT-I), in managing COVID-19-induced\ninsomnia among patients and hospital staff.\n  Method: A before-and-after design assessed the impact of supportive care by a\npsychiatrist on anxiety and insomnia in 18 hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Four\nCBT-I sessions (20 minutes to an hour each) were administered. Baseline\nassessments included sleep efficiency, insomnia severity, and generalized\nanxiety disorder symptoms.

We used a sample of 28,749 Facebook\nusers to build a language prediction model of survey-reported depression and\nanxiety, and validated it on Twitter on a sample of 887 users who had taken\nanxiety and depression surveys. We then applied it to a different set of 4,132\nTwitter users to impute language-based depression and anxiety labels, and\nextracted interpretable features of posted and profile pictures to uncover the\nassociations with users' depression and anxiety, controlling for demographics.\nFor depression, we find that profile pictures suppress positive emotions rather\nthan display more negative emotions, likely because of social media\nself-presentation biases. They also tend to show the single face of the user\n(rather than show her in groups of friends), marking increased focus on the\nself, emblematic for depression. Posted images are dominated by grayscale and\nlow aesthetic cohesion across a variety of image features. Profile images of\nanxious users are similarly marked by grayscale and low aesthetic cohesion, but\nless so than those of depressed users. Finally, we show that image features can\nbe used to predict depression and anxiety, and that multitask learning that\nincludes a joint modeling of demographics improves prediction performance.\nOverall, we find that the image attributes that mark depression and anxiety\noffer a rich lens into these conditions largely congruent with the\npsychological literature, and that images on Twitter allow inferences about the\nmental health status of users.",

We investigate the unusual reactions of investors when aiming to sell an\nasset under such adverse market conditions. Mathematically, we study the\noptimal stopping of the utility of an asset sale with a random discounting that\ncaptures the investor's overall impatience. The random discounting is given by\nthe cumulative amount of time spent by the drawdowns in an undesirable high\nregion, fine tuned by the investor's personal tolerance and anxiety about\ndrawdowns. We prove that in addition to the traditional take-profit sales, the\nreal-life employed stop-loss orders and trailing stops may become part of the\noptimal selling strategy, depending on different personal characteristics.

Distinguishing\nnegative emotions of similar valence could be important in contexts such as\nmental health. This project proposes a semi-supervised machine learning model\n(DASentimental) to extract depression, anxiety and stress from written text.\nFirst, we trained the model to spot how sequences of recalled emotion words by\n$N=200$ individuals correlated with their responses to the Depression Anxiety\nStress Scale (DASS-21). Within the framework of cognitive network science, we\nmodel every list of recalled emotions as a walk over a networked mental\nrepresentation of semantic memory, with emotions connected according to free\nassociations in people's memory. Among several tested machine learning\napproaches, we find that a multilayer perceptron neural network trained on word\nsequences and semantic network distances can achieve state-of-art,\ncross-validated predictions for depression ($R = 0.7$), anxiety ($R = 0.44$)\nand stress ($R = 0.52$). Though limited by sample size, this first-of-its-kind\napproach enables quantitative explorations of key semantic dimensions behind\nDAS levels. We find that semantic distances between recalled emotions and the\ndyad \"sad-happy\" are crucial features for estimating depression levels but are\nless important for anxiety and stress. We also find that semantic distance of\nrecalls from \"fear\" can boost the prediction of anxiety but it becomes\nredundant when the \"sad-happy\" dyad is considered.

RAR has strong correspondences with False Alarm Theory, Benign\nViolation Theory, and Cognitive Debugging Theory, all of which represent either\nspecial cases or partial descriptions at alternative levels of analysis. Some\nevidence for RAR includes physiological similarities between hyperventilation\nand laughter and the fact that smiles often indicate negative affect in\nnon-human primates (e.g. fear grimaces where teeth are exposed as a kind of\ninhibited threat display). In accordance with Benign Violation Theory, if humor\nreliably indicates both a) anxiety induction, b) anxiety reduction, and c) the\ntime-course over which anxiety is reduced, then the intersection of these\nconditions productively constrains inference spaces over latent mental states\nwith respect to the values and capacities of the persons experiencing humor. In\nthis way, humor is a powerful cypher for understanding persons in both\nindividual and social contexts, with far-reaching implications. Finally, if\nhumor can be expressed in such a simple formula with clear ties to\nphenomenology, and yet this discovery regarding such an essential part of the\nhuman experience has remained undiscovered for this long, then this is an\nextremely surprising state of affairs worthy of further investigation. Towards\nthis end, I propose an analogy can be found with consciousness studies, where\nin addition to the \"Hard problem\" of trying to explain humor, we would do well\nto consider a \"Meta-Problem\" of why humor seems so difficult to explain, and\nwhy relatively simple explanations may have eluded us for this long.

It takes a model that can identify potential users\nwho experience depression and anxiety on textual data to get treatment earlier.\nText classification techniques can achieve this. One approach that can be used\nis LSTM as an RNN architecture development in dealing with vanishing gradient\nproblems. Standard LSTM does not capture enough information because it can only\nread sentences from one direction. Meanwhile, Bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM) is a\ntwo-way LSTM that can capture information without ignoring the context and\nmeaning of a sentence. The proposed BiLSTM model is higher than all traditional\nmachine learning models and standard LSTMs. Based on the test results, the\nhighest accuracy obtained by BiLSTM reached 94.12%. This study has succeeded in\ndeveloping a model for the detection of depression and anxiety in Twitter\nusers.",

    "abstract": "Virtual reality interview simulator (VRIS) provides an effective and\nmanageable approach for candidates prone to being very nervous during\ninterviews, yet, the major anxiety-inducing elements remain unknown. During an\ninterview, the anxiety levels, overall experience, and performance of\ninterviewees might be affected by various circumstances. By analyzing\nelectrodermal activity and questionnaire, we investigated the influence of five\nvariables: (I) \\textit{Realism}; (II) \\textit{Question type}; (III)\n\\textit{Interviewer attitude}; (IV) \\textit{Timing}; and (V)\n\\textit{Preparation}. As such, an orthogonal design $L_8(4^1 \\times 2^4)$ with\neight experiments ($O A_8$ matrix) was implemented, in which 19 college\nstudents took part in the experiments. Considering the anxiety, overall\nexperience, and performance of the interviewees, results indicate that\n\\textit{Question type} plays a major role; secondly, \\textit{Realism},\n\\textit{Preparation}, and \\textit{Interviewer attitude} all have some degree of\ninfluence; lastly, \\textit{Timing} have little to no impact. Specifically,\nprofessional interview questions elicited a greater degree of anxiety than\npersonal ones among the categories of interview questions. This work\ncontributes to our understanding of anxiety-stimulating factors during job\ninterviews in virtual reality and provides cues for designing future VRIS.",

It has been shown that repeated social defeats\nin 10 daily agonistic interactions in male mice led to development of the\nexpressed level of anxiety and to reduction of communication estimated in the\nelevated plus-maze and partition tests, respectively. In the social\ninteractions test, sociable behavior toward unfamiliar partner and exploratory\nactivity were dramatically decreased in defeated male mice. Avoidance of\napproaching partner was significantly increased. Demonstration of self-grooming\nbehavior was increased in defeated males. Chronic diazepam treatment (0.5\nmg/kg, i.p., 2 weeks) led to significant decrease of anxiety level estimated in\nthe elevated plus maze test and to improvement of communication in the\npartition test. In the social interaction test diazepam completely restored the\nlevel of sociability and exploratory activity and reduced avoidance behavior of\napproaching partner. Diazepam did not affect self-grooming demonstration. It is\nconcluded that main factor which provokes decrease in communication in defeated\nmale mice is the high level of anxiety. Similarity between changes in social\nbehavior in defeated mice and symptoms of autism in humans is discussed. It is\nsupposed that this behavioral approach may be useful for studying the molecular\nmechanisms of autistic spectrum disorders, developing under chronic negative\nsocial experiences.",

Multiple experiments with\ndifferent variants are performed to explore the impact of number of layers and\ninput feature descriptors. The comparison of proposed approach and five of the\nexisting techniques show that the proposed model performed consistently better\nthan existing techniques with lowest error.",

The\nproportion of people reporting anxiety is 26%, and depression is 34% points.\nDisentangling associational and causal contributions of behavior, COVID-19\ncases, and economic distress on mental distress will dictate different\nmitigation strategies to reduce long-term pandemic-related mental distress.\nMethods We use the Household Pulse Survey (HPS) April 2020 to February 2021\ndata to examine mental distress among U.S. citizens attributable to COVID-19.\nWe combined HPS survey data with publicly available state-level weekly:\nCOVID-19 case and death data from the Centers for Disease Control, public\npolicies, and Apple and Google mobility data. Finally, we constructed economic\nand mental distress measures to estimate structural models with lag dependent\nvariables to tease out public health policies' associational and causal path\ncoefficients on economic and mental distress. Findings From April 2020 to\nFebruary 2021, we found that anxiety and depression had steadily climbed in the\nU.S. By design, mobility restrictions primarily affected public health policies\nwhere businesses and restaurants absorbed the biggest hit. Period t-1 COVID-19\ncases increased job loss by 4.1% and economic distress by 6.3% points in the\nsame period. Job-loss and housing insecurity in t-1 increased period t mental\ndistress by 29.1% and 32.7%, respectively. However, t-1 food insecurity\ndecreased mental distress by 4.9% in time t. The pandemic-related potential\ncausal path coefficient of period t-1 economic distress on period t depression\nis 57.8%, and anxiety is 55.9%.

This can be an arduous learning process\nespecially for motor imagery BCI. Various training methods were proposed to\nassist users in accomplishing BCI control and increase performance. Notably the\nuse of biased feedback, i.e. non-realistic representation of performance.\nBenefits of biased feedback on performance and learning vary between users\n(e.g. depending on their initial level of BCI control) and remain speculative.\nTo disentangle the speculations, we investigate what personality type, initial\nstate and calibration performance (CP) could benefit from a biased feedback.\nMethods. We conduct an experiment (n=30 for 2 sessions). The feedback provided\nto each group (n=10) is either positively, negatively or not biased. Results.\nStatistical analyses suggest that interactions between bias and: 1) workload,\n2) anxiety, and 3) self-control significantly affect online performance. For\ninstance, low initial workload paired with negative bias is associated to\nhigher peak performances (86%) than without any bias (69%). High anxiety\nrelates negatively to performance no matter the bias (60%), while low anxiety\nmatches best with negative bias (76%). For low CP, learning rate (LR) increases\nwith negative bias only short term (LR=2%) as during the second session it\nseverely drops (LR=-1%). Conclusion. We unveil many interactions between said\nhuman factors and bias. Additionally, we use prediction models to confirm and\nreveal even more interactions. Significance.

This shows a research need for an in-depth\nunderstanding of EV adoption behavior with a focus on one of the main barriers\nto the mass EV adoption, which is the limited electric driving range. The\npresent study extends the existing literature in two directions; First, the\ninfluence of the psychological aspect of driving range, which is referred to as\nrange anxiety, is explored on EV adoption behavior by presenting a nested logit\n(NL) model with a latent construct. Second, the two-level NL model captures\nindividuals' decision on EV adoption behavior distinguished by vehicle\ntransaction type and EV type, where the upper level yields the vehicle\ntransaction type selected from the set of alternatives including\nno-transaction, sell, trade, and add. The fuel type of the vehicles decided to\nbe acquired, either as traded-for or added vehicles, is simultaneously\ndetermined at the lower level from a set including conventional vehicle, hybrid\nEV, PHEV, and BEV.

Through causal inference, we demonstrate that positive life events\nincrease positive affect, while negative events increase stress, anxiety and\nnegative affect. While most events have a transient effect on psychological\nstates, major negative events, like illness or attending a funeral, can reduce\npositive affect for multiple days. Next, we assess whether these events can be\ndetected through wearable sensors, which can cheaply and unobtrusively monitor\nhealth-related factors. We show that these sensors paired with embedding-based\nlearning models can be used ``in the wild'' to capture atypical life events in\nhundreds of workers across both datasets.

To identify individuals who are vulnerable to\ndepression and anxiety, predictive models have been built that typically\nutilize data from one source.

To integrate the different types of\ninformation, we model the NetHealth data as a heterogeneous information network\n(HIN). Then, we redefine the problem of predicting individuals' mental health\nconditions (depression or anxiety) in a novel manner, as applying to our HIN a\npopular paradigm of a recommender system (RS), which is typically used to\npredict the preference that a person would give to an item (e.g., a movie or\nbook). In our case, the items are the individuals' different mental health\nstates. We evaluate four state-of-the-art RS approaches. Also, we model the\nprediction of individuals' mental health as another problem type - that of node\nclassification (NC) in our HIN, evaluating in the process four node features\nunder logistic regression as a proof-of-concept classifier. We find that our RS\nand NC network methods produce more accurate predictions than a logistic\nregression model using the same NetHealth data in the traditional non-network\nfashion as well as a random-approach.

    "abstract": "Background Network analyses on psychopathological data focus on the network\nstructure and its derivatives such as node centrality. One conclusion one can\ndraw from centrality measures is that the node with the highest centrality is\nlikely to be the node that is determined most by its neighboring nodes.\nHowever, centrality is a relative measure: knowing that a node is highly\ncentral gives no information about the extent to which it is determined by its\nneighbors. Here we provide an absolute measure of determination (or\ncontrollability) of a node - its predictability. We introduce predictability,\nestimate the predictability of all nodes in 18 prior empirical network papers\non psychopathology, and statistically relate it to centrality.\n  Methods We carried out a literature review and collected 25 datasets from 18\npublished papers in the field (several mood and anxiety disorders, substance\nabuse, psychosis, autism, and transdiagnostic data). We fit state-of-the-art\nnet- work models to all datasets, and computed the predictability of all nodes.\n  Results Predictability was unrelated to sample size, moderately high in most\nsymptom networks, and differed considerable both within and between datasets.\nPredictability was higher in community than clinical samples, highest for mood\nand anxiety disorders, and lowest for psychosis.\n  Conclusions Predictability is an important additional characterization of\nsymptom networks because it gives an absolute measure of the controllability of\neach node. It allows conclusions about how self-determined a symptom network\nis, and may help to inform intervention strategies. Limitations of\npredictability along with future directions are discussed.",

    "abstract": "Development of new medications is a very lengthy and costly process. Finding\nnovel indications for existing drugs, or drug repositioning, can serve as a\nuseful strategy to shorten the development cycle. In this study, we present an\napproach to drug discovery or repositioning by predicting indication for a\nparticular disease based on expression profiles of drugs, with a focus on\napplications in psychiatry. Drugs that are not originally indicated for the\ndisease but with high predicted probabilities serve as good candidates for\nrepurposing. This framework is widely applicable to any chemicals or drugs with\nexpression profiles measured, even if the drug targets are unknown. It is also\nhighly flexible as virtually any supervised learning algorithms can be used. We\napplied this approach to identify repositioning opportunities for schizophrenia\nas well as depression and anxiety disorders. We applied various\nstate-of-the-art machine learning (ML) approaches for prediction, including\ndeep neural networks, support vector machines (SVM), elastic net, random forest\nand gradient boosted machines. The performance of the five approaches did not\ndiffer substantially, with SVM slightly outperformed the others. However,\nmethods with lower predictive accuracy can still reveal literature-supported\ncandidates that are of different mechanisms of actions. As a further\nvalidation, we showed that the repositioning hits are enriched for psychiatric\nmedications considered in clinical trials. Notably, many top repositioning hits\nare supported by previous preclinical or clinical studies. Finally, we propose\nthat ML approaches may provide a new avenue to explore drug mechanisms via\nexamining the variable importance of gene features.",

Some countries took severe resections in the form of full-scale\nlockdown, while others took a moderate approach of dealing with the pandemics,\nfor example, mass testing, prohibiting large-scale public gatherings,\nrestricting international travels. South America adopted primarily the lockdown\nstrategies due to inadequate economy and health care support. Since the social\ninteractions between the people are primarily affected by the lockdown,\npsychological distress, e.g. anxiety, stress, fear are supposedly affecting the\nSouth American population in a severe way. This paper aims to explore the\nimpact of lockdown over the psychological aspect of the people of all the\nSpanish speaking South American capitals. We have utilized infodemiology\napproach by employing large-scale Twitter data-set over 33 million feeds in\norder to understand people's interaction over the months of this on-going\ncoronavirus pandemic. Our result is surprising: at the beginning of the\npandemic, people demonstrated strong emotions (i.e. anxiety, worry, fear) which\ndeclined over time even though the actual pandemic is worsening by having more\npositive cases, and inflicting more deaths. This leads us to speculate that the\nSouth American population is adapting to this pandemic thus improving the\noverall psychological distress.",

    "abstract": "This study investigates how students and researchers shape their knowledge\nand perception of educational topics. The mindset or forma mentis of 159\nItalian high school students and of 59 international researchers in STEM are\nreconstructed through forma mentis networks, i.e., cognitive networks of\nconcepts connected by free associations and enriched with sentiment labels. The\nlayout of conceptual associations between positively/negatively/neutrally\nperceived concepts is informative on how people build their own mental\nconstructs or beliefs about specific topics. Researchers displayed mixed\npositive/neutral mental representations of ``teacher'', ``student'' and,\n``scientist''. Students' conceptual associations of ``scientist'' were highly\npositive and largely non-stereotypical, although links about the ``mad\nscientist'' stereotype persisted. Students perceived ``teacher'' as a complex\nfigure, associated with positive aspects like mentoring/knowledge transmission\nbut also to negative sides revolving around testing and grading. ``School''\nelicited stronger differences between the two groups. In the students' mindset,\n``school'' was surrounded by a negative emotional aura or set of associations,\nindicating an anxious perception of the school setting, mixing scholastic\nconcepts, anxiety-eliciting words, STEM disciplines like maths and physics, and\nexam-related notions. Researchers' positive stance of ``school'' included\nconcepts of fun, friendship, and personal growth instead. Along the perspective\nof Education Research, the above results are discussed as quantitative evidence\nfor test- and STEM anxiety co-occurring in the way Italian students perceive\neducation places and their actors. Detecting these patterns in student\npopulations through forma mentis networks offers new, simple to gather yet\ndetailed knowledge for future data-informed intervention policies and action\nresearch.",

The goal of this study is\nto examine, among college students, the relationship between deteriorating\nmental health conditions and changes in user behaviors when engaging with\nGoogle Search and YouTube during COVID-19. This study recruited a cohort of 49\nstudents from a U.S. college campus during January 2020 (prior to the pandemic)\nand measured the anxiety and depression levels of each participant.

The longitudinal Google\nSearch and YouTube history data were anonymized and collected. From\nindividual-level Google Search and YouTube histories, we developed 5 signals\nthat can quantify shifts in online behaviors during the pandemic. We then\nassessed the differences between groups with and without deteriorating mental\nhealth profiles in terms of these features. Significant features included\nlate-night online activities, continuous usages, and time away from the\ninternet, porn consumptions, and keywords associated with negative emotions,\nsocial activities, and personal affairs.

Here, existing commercial services help drivers to find available\nstations based on real-time availability data but struggle with data\ninaccuracy, e.g., due to conventional vehicles blocking the access to public\ncharging stations. In this context, recent works have studied stochastic search\nmethods to account for availability uncertainty in order to minimize a driver's\ndetour until reaching an available charging station. So far, both practical and\ntheoretical approaches ignore driver coordination enabled by charging requests\ncentralization or sharing of data, e.g., sharing observations of charging\nstations' availability or visit intentions between drivers.

Our algorithm models the process knowledge through explicitly modeling\nsafety, knowledge capture, and explainability. LMs augmented with ProKnow\nguided method generated 89% safer questions in the depression and anxiety\ndomain. The Explainability of the generated question is assessed by computing\nsimilarity with concepts in depression and anxiety knowledge bases. Overall,\nirrespective of the type of LMs augmented with our ProKnow, we achieved an\naverage 82% improvement over simple pre-trained LMs on safety, explainability,\nand process-guided question generation. We qualitatively and quantitatively\nevaluate the efficacy of the proposed ProKnow-guided methods by introducing\nthree new evaluation metrics for safety, explainability, and process knowledge\nadherence.",

    "abstract": "Large language models are becoming increasingly integrated into our lives.\nHence, it is important to understand the biases present in their outputs in\norder to avoid perpetuating harmful stereotypes, which originate in our own\nflawed ways of thinking. This challenge requires developing new benchmarks and\nmethods for quantifying affective and semantic bias, keeping in mind that LLMs\nact as psycho-social mirrors that reflect the views and tendencies that are\nprevalent in society. One such tendency that has harmful negative effects is\nthe global phenomenon of anxiety toward math and STEM subjects. Here, we\ninvestigate perceptions of math and STEM fields provided by cutting-edge\nlanguage models, namely GPT-3, Chat-GPT, and GPT-4, by applying an approach\nfrom network science and cognitive psychology. Specifically, we use behavioral\nforma mentis networks (BFMNs) to understand how these LLMs frame math and STEM\ndisciplines in relation to other concepts. We use data obtained by probing the\nthree LLMs in a language generation task that has previously been applied to\nhumans. Our findings indicate that LLMs have an overall negative perception of\nmath and STEM fields, with math being perceived most negatively. We observe\nsignificant differences across the three LLMs. We observe that newer versions\n(i.e. GPT-4) produce richer, more complex perceptions as well as less negative\nperceptions compared to older versions and N=159 high-school students. These\nfindings suggest that advances in the architecture of LLMs may lead to\nincreasingly less biased models that could even perhaps someday aid in reducing\nharmful stereotypes in society rather than perpetuating them.",

Therefore, to find out what\nkind of employees have cooperated with the company's measures in the current\ncorona (COVID-19) crisis, and what effect the cooperation has had to these\nemployees/companies to get hints for preparing for the next crisis, the pass\nanalysis was carried out using awareness data obtained from a questionnaire\nsurvey conducted on 2,973 employees of Japanese companies in China. The results\nshowed that employees with higher social capital and resilience were more\nsupportive of the company's measures against corona and that employees who were\nmore supportive of corona measures were less likely to leave their jobs.\nHowever, regarding fatigue and anxiety about the corona felt by employees, it\nwas shown that it not only works to support cooperation in corona\ncountermeasures but also enhances the turnover intention. This means that just\nby raising the anxiety of employees, even if a company achieves the short-term\ngoal of having them cooperate with the company's countermeasures against\ncorona, it may not reach the longer-term goal by making them increase their\nintention to leave. It is important for employees to be aware of the crisis and\nto fear it properly.

    "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic has represented a challenge for higher education in\nterms to provide quality education despite the lockdown periods, the\ntransformation of the in-person classes to virtual classes, and the\ndemotivation and anxiety that are experimented by the students. Because the\nbasis of engineering is the experimentation through hands-on activities and\nlearning by doing, the lockdown periods and the temporary suspension of the\nin-person classes and laboratories have meant a problem for educators that try\nto teach and motivate the students despite the situation. In this context, this\nstudy presents an educational methodology based on Problem-Based Learning (PBL)\nand in-home laboratories in engineering. The methodology was carried out in two\nphases during 2020, in the academic programs of Industrial Engineering and\nTechnology in Electronics with (n=44) students. The in-home laboratories were\nsent to the students as part of \"kits\" with the devices needed in each subject.\nBesides, due to the difficulties in monitoring the learning process, the\nstudents made videos and blogs as a strategy to reinforce their learning and\nevidence the progress in the courses. The outcomes of the methodology show\nmainly the following points: (1) An improvement of the academic performance and\nlearning of the students in the courses. (2) A positive influence of the usage\nof in-home laboratories in motivation, self-efficacy, and reduction of anxiety.\n(3) Positive correlations between the usage of in-home laboratories, the blogs\nand videos, and the teacher's feedback for learning, motivation, and\nself-efficacy. Thus, these results evidence that other alternatives that gather\nthe cognitive and affective learning domains can emerge from engineering to\ndeal with the educational problems produced by the crisis periods.",

    "abstract": "Mental health disorders are the leading cause of health-related problems\nglobally. It is projected that mental health disorders will be the leading\ncause of morbidity among adults as the incidence rates of anxiety and\ndepression grows globally. Recently, extended reality (XR), a general term\ncovering virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR) and mixed reality (MR),\nis paving a new way to deliver mental health care. In this paper, we conduct a\nscoping review on the development and application of XR in the area of mental\ndisorders. We performed a scoping database search to identify the relevant\nstudies indexed in Google Scholar, PubMed, and the ACM Digital Library. A\nsearch period between August 2016 and December 2023 was defined to select\narticles related to the usage of VR, AR, and MR in a mental health context. We\nidentified a total of 85 studies from 27 countries across the globe. By\nperforming data analysis, we found that most of the studies focused on\ndeveloped countries such as the US (16.47%) and Germany (12.94%). None of the\nstudies were for African countries. The majority of the articles reported that\nXR techniques led to a significant reduction in symptoms of anxiety or\ndepression. More studies were published in the year 2021, i.e., 31.76% (n =\n31). This could indicate that mental disorder intervention received a higher\nattention when COVID-19 emerged. Most studies (n = 65) focused on a population\nbetween 18 and 65 years old, only a few studies focused on teenagers (n = 2).\nAlso, more studies were done experimentally (n = 67, 78.82%) rather than by\nanalytical and modeling approaches (n = 8, 9.41%). This shows that there is a\nrapid development of XR technology for mental health care. Furthermore, these\nstudies showed that XR technology can effectively be used for evaluating mental\ndisorders in similar or better way as the conventional approaches.",

    "abstract": "This paper states the case for applying the conceptual and analytic tools\nassociated with the study of entropy in physical systems to cognition, focusing\non creative cognition. It is proposed that minds modify their contents and\nadapt to their environments to minimize psychological entropy:\narousal-provoking uncertainty, which can be experienced negatively as anxiety,\nor positively as a wellspring for creativity (or both). Thus, intrinsically\nmotivated creativity begins with detection of high psychological entropy\nmaterial (e.g., a question or inconsistency), which provokes uncertainty and is\narousal-inducing. This material is recursively considering from new contexts\nuntil it is sufficiently restructured that arousal dissipates and entropy\nreaches an acceptable level. Restructuring involves neural synchrony and\ndynamic binding, and may be facilitated by temporarily shifting to a more\nassociative mode of thought. The creative outcome may similarly induce\nrestructuring in others, and thereby contribute to the cultural evolution of\nmore nuanced understandings. Thus, the concept of entropy could play a unifying\nrole in cognitive science as a driver of thought and action, and in cultural\nstudies as the driver of the creative innovations that fuel cultural evolution.\nThe paper concludes with an invitation for cross-disciplinary exploration of\nthis potential new arena of entropy studies.",

    "abstract": "The development of mobile phones has largely increased human interactions.\nWhilst the use of these devices for communication has received significant\nattention, there has been little analysis of more passive interactions. Through\ncensus data on casual social groups, this work suggests a clear pattern of\nmobile phones being carried in people's hands, without the person using it\n(that is, not looking at it). Moreover, this study suggests that when\nindividuals join members of the opposite sex there is a clear tendency to stop\nholding mobile phones whilst walking. Although it is not clear why people hold\ntheir phones whilst walking in such large proportions (38% of solitary women,\nand 31% of solitary men), we highlight several possible explanation for holding\nthe device, including the need to advertise status and affluence, to maintain\nimmediate connection with friends and family, and to mitigate feelings related\nto anxiety and security.",

Secondly, (PH)EVs have the\nability to regenerate energy from braking, which make routes with many\naccerelations and decelerations not as unattractive for drivers of (PH)EVs as\nfor drivers of vehicles with an internal combustion engine (ICE). This paper\ncombines this, and adds drivers might prefer a lower speed limit due to a lower\nenergy consumption. These elements are compared to with road characteristics.\nIt is found, motorways are usually less favourable for drivers of (PH)EVs\ncompared to drivers of ICE vehicles, and they will prefer the shorter routes on\nsecondary roads or through towns. This will influence the use of the underlying\nroad network, and thereby affecting congestion, emissions and safety.

Therefore, managing individual\npreferences is not enough to provide these people with suitable\nrecommendations. In order to address this issue, we propose a Top-N\nrecommendation model that combines the user's idiosyncratic aversions with\nher/his preferences in a personalized way to suggest the most compatible and\nlikable Points of Interest for her/him. We are interested in finding a\nuser-specific balance of compatibility and interest within a recommendation\nmodel that integrates heterogeneous evaluation criteria to appropriately take\nthese aspects into account. We tested our model on both ASD and \"neurotypical\"\npeople. The evaluation results show that, on both groups, our model outperforms\nin accuracy and ranking capability the recommender systems based on item\ncompatibility, on user preferences, or which integrate these two aspects by\nmeans of a uniform evaluation model.",

We validated our virtual environment by analyzing whether\nit was preferred to no VR system and accepted regardless of the existence of a\nvirtual audience. Our results show that users overwhelmingly prefer to use the\nVR system as a tool to help them improve their public speaking skills than\ntraining in an empty environment. However, the preference for an audience is\nmixed.",

    "abstract": "PhD students report a higher prevalence of mental illness symptoms than\nhighly educated individuals in the general population. This situation presents\na serious problem for universities. Thus, the knowledge about this phenomenon\nis of great importance in decision-making. In this paper we use the Nature PhD\nsurvey 2019 and estimate several binomial logistic regression models to analyze\nthe risk of interrupting doctoral studies. This risk is measured through the\ndesire of change in either the supervisor or the area of expertise, or the wish\nof not pursue a PhD. Among the explanatory factors, we focus on the influence\nof anxiety/depression, discrimination, and bullying. As control variables we\nuse demographic characteristics and others related with the doctoral program.\nInsufficient contact time with supervisors, and exceeding time spent studying\n-crossing the 50-h week barrier-, are risk factors of PhD studies interruption,\nbut the most decisive risk factor is poor mental health. Universities should\ntherefore foster an environment of well-being, which allows the development of\nautonomy and resilience of their PhD students or, when necessary, which fosters\nthe development of conflict resolution skills.",

The application to\nnowcasting GDP growth as well as a simulation study demonstrate that the\nhorseshoe prior BSTS improves markedly upon the SSVS and the original BSTS\nmodel with the largest gains in dense data-generating-processes. Our\napplication also shows that a large dimensional set of search terms is able to\nimprove nowcasts early in a specific quarter before other macroeconomic data\nbecome available.

    "abstract": "Does technological change destroy or create jobs? New technologies may\nreplace human workers, but can simultaneously create jobs if workers are needed\nto use these technologies or if new economic activities emerge. Furthermore,\ntechnology-driven productivity growth may increase disposable income,\nstimulating a demand-induced expansion of employment. To synthesize the\nexisting knowledge on this question, we systematically review the empirical\nliterature on the past four decades of technological change and its impact on\nemployment, distinguishing between five broad technology categories (ICT,\nRobots, Innovation, TFP-style, Other). Overall, we find across studies that the\nlabor-displacing effect of technology appears to be more than offset by\ncompensating mechanisms that create or reinstate labor. This holds for most\ntypes of technology, suggesting that previous anxieties over widespread\ntechnology-driven unemployment lack an empirical base, at least so far.\nNevertheless, low-skill, production, and manufacturing workers have been\nadversely affected by technological change, and effective up- and reskilling\nstrategies should remain at the forefront of policy making along with targeted\nsocial support systems.",

We focus on how targeted\nweight-loss advertisements harm people with histories of disordered eating. We\nidentify three features of targeted advertising that cause harm: the\npersistence of personal data that can expose vulnerabilities, over-simplifying\nalgorithmic relevancy models, and design patterns encouraging engagement that\ncan facilitate unhealthy behavior. Through a series of semi-structured\ninterviews with individuals with histories of unhealthy body stigma, dieting,\nand disordered eating, we found that targeted weight-loss ads reinforced low\nself-esteem and deepened pre-existing anxieties around food and exercise. At\nthe same time, we observed that targeted individuals demonstrated agency and\nresistance against distressing ads. Drawing on scholarship in postcolonial\nenvironmental studies, we use the concept of slow violence to articulate how\nonline targeted advertising inflicts harms that may not be immediately\nidentifiable.

    "abstract": "This work presents a machine learning approach to predict peak-stress\nclusters in heterogeneous polycrystalline materials. Prior work on using\nmachine learning in the context of mechanics has largely focused on predicting\nthe effective response and overall structure of stress fields. However, their\nability to predict peak stresses -- which are of critical importance to failure\n-- is unexplored, because the peak-stress clusters occupy a small spatial\nvolume relative to the entire domain, and hence requires computationally\nexpensive training. This work develops a deep-learning based Convolutional\nEncoder-Decoder method that focuses on predicting peak-stress clusters,\nspecifically on the size and other characteristics of the clusters in the\nframework of heterogeneous linear elasticity. This method is based on\nconvolutional filters that model local spatial relations between\nmicrostructures and stress fields using spatially weighted averaging\noperations. The model is first trained against linear elastic calculations of\nstress under applied macroscopic strain in synthetically-generated\nmicrostructures, which serves as the ground truth. The trained model is then\napplied to predict the stress field given a (synthetically-generated)\nmicrostructure and then to detect peak-stress clusters within the predicted\nstress field. The accuracy of the peak-stress predictions is analyzed using the\ncosine similarity metric and by comparing the geometric characteristics of the\npeak-stress clusters against the ground-truth calculations. It is observed that\nthe model is able to learn and predict the geometric details of the peak-stress\nclusters and, in particular, performed better for higher (normalized) values of\nthe peak stress as compared to lower values of the peak stress. These\ncomparisons showed that the proposed method is well-suited to predict the\ncharacteristics of peak-stress clusters.",

Although many rocky exoplanets closely\norbiting their host stars have been detected, all studies to date of plate\ntectonics on exoplanets have neglected tidal stresses in the planet's\nlithosphere.

    "abstract": "In the pregnant mother and her fetus, chronic prenatal stress results in\nentrainment of the fetal heartbeat by the maternal heartbeat, quantified by the\nfetal stress index (FSI). Deep learning (DL) is capable of pattern detection in\ncomplex medical data with high accuracy in noisy real-life environments, but\nlittle is known about DL's utility in non-invasive biometric monitoring during\npregnancy. A recently established self-supervised learning (SSL) approach to DL\nprovides emotional recognition from electrocardiogram (ECG). We hypothesized\nthat SSL will identify chronically stressed mother-fetus dyads from the raw\nmaternal abdominal electrocardiograms (aECG), containing fetal and maternal\nECG. Chronically stressed mothers and controls matched at enrolment at 32 weeks\nof gestation were studied. We validated the chronic stress exposure by\npsychological inventory, maternal hair cortisol and FSI. We tested two variants\nof SSL architecture, one trained on the generic ECG features for emotional\nrecognition obtained from public datasets and another transfer-learned on a\nsubset of our data. Our DL models accurately detect the chronic stress exposure\ngroup (AUROC=0.982+/-0.002), the individual psychological stress score\n(R2=0.943+/-0.009) and FSI at 34 weeks of gestation (R2=0.946+/-0.013), as well\nas the maternal hair cortisol at birth reflecting chronic stress exposure\n(0.931+/-0.006). The best performance was achieved with the DL model trained on\nthe public dataset and using maternal ECG alone. The present DL approach\nprovides a novel source of physiological insights into complex multi-modal\nrelationships between different regulatory systems exposed to chronic stress.\nThe final DL model can be deployed in low-cost regular ECG biosensors as a\nsimple, ubiquitous early stress detection and monitoring tool during pregnancy.\nThis discovery should enable early behavioral interventions.",

    "abstract": "Stress is a physiological state that hampers mental health and has serious\nconsequences to physical health. Moreover, the COVID-19 pandemic has increased\nstress levels among people across the globe. Therefore, continuous monitoring\nand detection of stress are necessary. The recent advances in wearable devices\nhave allowed the monitoring of several physiological signals related to stress.\nAmong them, wrist-worn wearable devices like smartwatches are most popular due\nto their convenient usage. And the photoplethysmography (PPG) sensor is the\nmost prevalent sensor in almost all consumer-grade wrist-worn smartwatches.\nTherefore, this paper focuses on using a wrist-based PPG sensor that collects\nBlood Volume Pulse (BVP) signals to detect stress which may be applicable for\nconsumer-grade wristwatches. Moreover, state-of-the-art works have used either\nclassical machine learning algorithms to detect stress using hand-crafted\nfeatures or have used deep learning algorithms like Convolutional Neural\nNetwork (CNN) which automatically extracts features. This paper proposes a\nnovel hybrid CNN (H-CNN) classifier that uses both the hand-crafted features\nand the automatically extracted features by CNN to detect stress using the BVP\nsignal. Evaluation on the benchmark WESAD dataset shows that, for 3-class\nclassification (Baseline vs. Stress vs. Amusement), our proposed H-CNN\noutperforms traditional classifiers and normal CNN by 5% and 7% accuracy, and\n10% and 7% macro F1 score, respectively. Also for 2-class classification\n(Stress vs. Non-stress), our proposed H-CNN outperforms traditional classifiers\nand normal CNN by 3% and ~5% accuracy, and ~3% and ~7% macro F1 score,\nrespectively.",

Mental health issues can, both directly\nand indirectly, affect other sections of human physiology and impede an\nindividual's day-to-day activities and performance. However, identifying the\nstress and finding the stress trend for an individual leading to serious mental\nailments is challenging and involves multiple factors. Such identification can\nbe achieved accurately by fusing these multiple modalities (due to various\nfactors) arising from behavioral patterns. Certain techniques are identified in\nthe literature for this purpose; however, very few machine learning-based\nmethods are proposed for such multimodal fusion tasks.

Current methods of\nstress detection lack: (i) robustness -- wearable health sensors contain high\nlevels of measurement noise that degrades performance, and (ii) adaptation --\nstatic architectures fail to adapt to changing contexts in sensing conditions.\nWe propose to address these deficiencies with SELF-CARE, a generalized\nselective sensor fusion method of stress detection that employs novel\ntechniques of context identification and ensemble machine learning.

First, the pressure profile\nis reconstructed in a polymer solution, which enable the simultaneous\nmeasurement of the first and the second normal stress differences $N_1$ and\n$N_2$, with a precision of 2 Pa. In a second part, we show that negative normal\nstresses can also be detected. Finally, we focus on the normal stress\nfluctuations that extend both spatially and temporally ina shear-thickening\nsuspension of cornstarch particles. We evidence the presence of local a unique\nheterogeneity rotating very regularly. In addition to their low-cost and high\nversatility, the sensors show here their potential to finely characterize the\nnormal stresses in viscosimetric flows.",

The times of stress level elevating are\nrandom and vary from product to product. In this paper we extend this model to\na more economic plan. The proposed extended model has two economical advantages\ncompared with the previous one. The first is that the times of stress level\nelevating in the new model are identical for all products, which enable us to\nuse only one chamber (oven) for testing all test units. The second is that, the\nnew method does not require continuous inspection and to elevate the stress\nlevel, it is not necessary for the experimenter to inspect the value of the\ndegradation continually. The new method decrease the cost of measurement and\nalso there is no need to use electronic sensors to detect the first passage\ntime of the degradation to the threshold value in the new method. We assume\nthat the degradation path follows a gamma process. The stress level is elevated\nas soon as the measurement of the degradation of one of the test units, at one\nof the specified times, exceeds the threshold value. Under the constraint that\nthe total experimental cost does not exceed a pre-specified budget, the optimal\nsettings including the optimal threshold value, sample size, measurement\nfrequency and termination time are obtained by minimizing the asymptotic\nvariance of an estimated quantile of the lifetime distribution of the product.\nA case study is presented to illustrate the proposed method.",

However, although stress is inextricably linked\nwith depression, researchers face these two tasks as two separate tasks. To\naddress these limitations, we present the first study, which exploits two\ndifferent datasets collected under different conditions, and introduce two\nmultitask learning frameworks, which use depression and stress as the main and\nauxiliary tasks respectively. Specifically, we use a depression dataset and a\nstressful dataset including stressful posts from ten subreddits of five\ndomains. In terms of the first approach, each post passes through a shared BERT\nlayer, which is updated by both tasks. Next, two separate BERT encoder layers\nare exploited, which are updated by each task separately.

Many works have studied handcrafted\nfeatures from various bio-signals that are indicators of stress. Recently, deep\nlearning models have also been proposed to detect stress. Typically, stress\nmodels are trained and validated on the same dataset, often involving one\nstressful scenario. However, it is not practical to collect stress data for\nevery scenario. So, it is crucial to study the generalizability of these models\nand determine to what extent they can be used in other scenarios. In this\npaper, we explore the generalization capabilities of Electrocardiogram\n(ECG)-based deep learning models and models based on handcrafted ECG features,\ni.e., Heart Rate Variability (HRV) features. To this end, we train three HRV\nmodels and two deep learning models that use ECG signals as input. We use ECG\nsignals from two popular stress datasets - WESAD and SWELL-KW - differing in\nterms of stressors and recording devices. First, we evaluate the models using\nleave-one-subject-out (LOSO) cross-validation using training and validation\nsamples from the same dataset. Next, we perform a cross-dataset validation of\nthe models, that is, LOSO models trained on the WESAD dataset are validated\nusing SWELL-KW samples and vice versa. While deep learning models achieve the\nbest results on the same dataset, models based on HRV features considerably\noutperform them on data from a different dataset. This trend is observed for\nall the models on both datasets. Therefore, HRV models are a better choice for\nstress recognition in applications that are different from the dataset\nscenario. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to compare the\ncross-dataset generalizability between ECG-based deep learning models and HRV\nmodels.",

An expert is needed to analyze a form of recording of\nparticipants and mark sections with different states such as stress and calm.\nWhile expensive, this method delivers a complete dataset with labeled data that\ncan be used in any number of supervised algorithms. An interesting question\narises from the expensive labeling: how can we reduce the cost while\nmaintaining high accuracy? Semi-Supervised learning (SSL) is a potential\nsolution to this problem. These algorithms allow for machine learning models to\nbe trained with only a small subset of labeled data (unlike unsupervised which\nuse no labels). They provide a way of avoiding expensive labeling. This paper\ncompares a fully supervised algorithm to a SSL on the public WESAD (Wearable\nStress and Affect Detection) Dataset for stress detection. This paper shows\nthat Semi-Supervised algorithms are a viable method for inexpensive affective\nstate detection systems with accurate results.",

This challenge becomes more\nproblematic when the user/patient is mentally or physically active or stressed\nbecause of more frequent conscious or subconscious movements. In this paper, we\npropose ReLearn, a robust machine learning framework for stress detection from\nbiomarkers extracted from multimodal physiological signals. ReLearn effectively\ncopes with missing data and outliers both at training and inference phases.\nReLearn, composed of machine learning models for feature selection, outlier\ndetection, data imputation, and classification, allows us to classify all\nsamples, including those with missing values at inference. In particular,\naccording to our experiments and stress database, while by discarding all\nmissing data, as a simplistic yet common approach, no prediction can be made\nfor 34% of the data at inference, our approach can achieve accurate\npredictions, as high as 78%, for missing samples. Also, our experiments show\nthat the proposed framework obtains a cross-validation accuracy of 86.8% even\nif more than 50% of samples within the features are missing.",

If the bulk modulus of the magma\nchamber is below a critical value, the magma chamber Coulomb stresses will\nexceed the tidal ones and the phase of tidal triggering will be inverted.

Existing approaches of coercion\nresistant authentication systems (CRAS) propose authentication factors such as\nimplicit learning tasks, which are non-transferable, but still have the\ndrawback that an attacker can force the victim (causing stress) to perform the\ntask in order to gain unauthorized access. Alternatively, there could be cases\nwhere the user could claim that they were coerced into giving up the\nauthentication materials, whereas in reality they acted as an insider attacker.\nTherefore, being able to detect stress during authentication also helps to\nachieve non-repudiation in such cases. To address these concerns, we need CRAS\nthat have both the non-transferable property as well as a mechanism to detect\nstress related to coercion. In this paper, we study the feasibility of using\nChill (intensely pleasurable) music as a stimulus to elicit unique\nneuro-physiological responses that can be used as an authenticating factor for\nCRAS. Chill music and stress are both stimuli for a neuro-chemical called\nDopamine. However, they release the Dopamine at different parts of the brain,\nresulting in different neuro-physiological responses, which gives us both the\nnon-transferable and stress-detection properties necessary for CRAS. We have\nexperimentally validated our proposed Chill music based CRAS using human\nsubjects and measuring their neuro-physiological responses on our prototype\nsystem.

The\nresearch challenge in speech emotion detection is defining the very meaning of\nstress and being able to categorize it in a precise manner. Supervised Machine\nLearning models, including state of the art Deep Learning classification\nmethods, rely on the availability of clean and labelled data. One of the\nproblems in affective computation and emotion detection is the limited amount\nof annotated data of stress. The existing labelled stress emotion datasets are\nhighly subjective to the perception of the annotator.\n  We address the first issue of feature selection by exploiting the use of\ntraditional MFCC features in Convolutional Neural Network. Our experiments show\nthat Emo-CNN consistently and significantly outperforms the popular existing\nmethods over multiple datasets. It achieves 90.2% categorical accuracy on the\nEmo-DB dataset. To tackle the second and the more significant problem of\nsubjectivity in stress labels, we use Lovheim's cube, which is a 3-dimensional\nprojection of emotions. The cube aims at explaining the relationship between\nthese neurotransmitters and the positions of emotions in 3D space. The learnt\nemotion representations from the Emo-CNN are mapped to the cube using three\ncomponent PCA (Principal Component Analysis) which is then used to model human\nstress.

    "abstract": "Oil and gas pipeline leakages lead to not only enormous economic loss but\nalso environmental disasters. How to detect the pipeline damages including\nleakages and cracks has attracted much research attention. One of the promising\nleakage detection method is to use lead zirconate titanate (PZT) transducers to\ndetect the negative pressure wave when leakage occurs. PZT transducers can\ngenerate and detect guided stress waves for crack detection also. However, the\nnegative pressure waves or guided stress waves may not be easily detected with\nenvironmental interference, e.g., the oil and gas pipelines in offshore\nenvironment. In this paper, a Gaussian mixture model based hidden Markov model\n(GMM-HMM) method is proposed to detect the pipeline leakage and crack depth in\nchanging environment and time-varying operational conditions. Leakages in\ndifferent sections or crack depths are considered as different states in hidden\nMarkov models (HMM). Laboratory experiments show that the GMM-HMM method can\nrecognize the crack depth and leakage of pipeline such as whether there is a\nleakage, where the leakage is.",

The main objective is to\ndemonstrate automated spatial recognition of healthy vs. stressed crop at a\nplant level. Specifically, we examine premature plant senescence resulting in\ndrought stress on Russet Burbank potato plants.

The\npaper also introduces a dataset of aerial field images acquired with a Parrot\nSequoia camera. The dataset includes manually annotated bounding boxes of\nhealthy and stressed plant regions. Experimental validation demonstrated the\nability for distinguishing healthy and stressed plants in field images,\nachieving an average dice score coefficient (DSC) of 0.74.

While detecting drivers' stress and negative emotions can significantly\nhelp with this goal, understanding what might be associated with increases in\ndrivers' negative emotions and high stress level, might better help with\nplanning interventions. While studies have provided significant insight into\ndetecting drivers' emotions and stress levels, not many studies focused on the\nreasons behind changes in stress levels and negative emotions. In this study,\nby using a naturalistic driving study database, we analyze the changes in the\ndriving scene, including road objects and the dynamical relationship between\nthe ego vehicle and the lead vehicle with respect to changes in drivers'\npsychophysiological metrics (i.e., heart rate (HR) and facial expressions). Our\nresults indicate that different road objects might be associated with varying\nlevels of increase in drivers' HR as well as different proportions of negative\nfacial emotions detected through computer vision. Larger vehicles on the road,\nsuch as trucks and buses, are associated with the highest amount of increase in\ndrivers' HR as well as negative emotions. Additionally, shorter distances and\nhigher standard deviation in the distance to the lead vehicle are associated\nwith a higher number of abrupt increases in drivers' HR, depicting a possible\nincrease in stress level. Our finding indicates more positive emotions, lower\nfacial engagement, and a lower abrupt increase in HR at a higher speed of\ndriving, which often happens in highway environments. This research\ncollectively shows that driving at higher speeds happening in highways by\navoiding certain road objects might be a better fit for keeping drivers in a\ncalmer, more positive state.",

In this work, we\nstudied the influence of the globally applied stress state on the evolution of\ndamage in such a microstructure. Classical damage models allow predictions of\ndamage during deformation based on considerations of the material as an\nisotropic continuum. Here, we investigate their validity in a dual phase\nmicrostructure that is locally dominated by its microstructural morphological\ncomplexity based on a statistical ensemble of thousands of individual voids\nformed under different stress states. For this purpose, we combined a\ncalibrated material model incorporating damage formation to assess the local\nstress state in samples with different notch geometries and high-resolution\nelectron microscopy of large areas using a deep learning-based automated\nmicrograph analysis to detect and classify microstructural voids according to\ntheir source of origin. This allowed us to obtain both the continuum stress\nstate during deformation and statistically relevant data of individual void\nformation. We found that the applied plastic strain is the major influence on\nthe overall number, and therefore the nucleation of new voids, while\ntriaxiality correlates with the median void size, supporting its proposed\ninfluence on void growth. In contrast, coalescence of voids leading to failure\nappears related to local instabilities in the form of shear band formation and\nis therefore only indirectly determined by the global stress state in that it\ndetermines the global distribution, density and size of voids.",

We first analyse the linear bubble\noscillation dynamics to measure the local, high-frequency viscosity of the\nmaterial. We then use acoustic pressure gradients to induce bubble translation\nand examine the elastic part of the response of the material below yielding. We\nfind that, at moderate pressure amplitude, the additional stresses applied by\nvolumetric oscillations and acoustic radiation forces do not lead to any\ndetectable irreversible bubble motion. At high pressure amplitude, we observe\nnon-spherical shape oscillations that result in erratic bubble motion. The\nshape modes and critical pressures we observe differ from the predictions of a\nrecent model of shape oscillations in soft solids.Based on our findings, we\ndiscuss possible reasons for the lack of bubble release in Carbopol and suggest\nother systems in which ultrasound-assisted bubble rise may be observed.",

    "abstract": "Directly examining subcellular mechanics whilst avoiding excessive strain of\na live cell requires the precise control of light stress on very small areas,\nwhich is fundamentally difficult. Here we use a glass nanopipet out of contact\nwith the plasma membrane to both exert the stress on the cell and also\naccurately monitor cellular compression. This allows the mapping of cell\nstiffness at a lateral resolution finer than 100 nm. We calculate the stress a\nnanopipet exerts on a cell as the sum of the intrinsic pressure between the tip\nface and the plasma membrane plus its direct pressure on any glycocalyx, both\nevaluated from the gap size in terms of the ion current decrease. A survey of\ncell types confirms that an intracellular pressure of approximately 120 Pa\nbegins to detach the plasma membrane from the cytoskeleton and reveals that the\nfirst 660 +/- 90 nm of compression of a neuron cell body is much softer than\nprevious methods have been able to detect.",

    "abstract": "In today's fast-paced world, the rates of stress and depression present a\nsurge. Social media provide assistance for the early detection of mental health\nconditions. Existing methods mainly introduce feature extraction approaches and\ntrain shallow machine learning classifiers. Other researches use deep neural\nnetworks or transformers. Despite the fact that transformer-based models\nachieve noticeable improvements, they cannot often capture rich factual\nknowledge. Although there have been proposed a number of studies aiming to\nenhance the pretrained transformer-based models with extra information or\nadditional modalities, no prior work has exploited these modifications for\ndetecting stress and depression through social media. In addition, although the\nreliability of a machine learning model's confidence in its predictions is\ncritical for high-risk applications, there is no prior work taken into\nconsideration the model calibration. To resolve the above issues, we present\nthe first study in the task of depression and stress detection in social media,\nwhich injects extra linguistic information in transformer-based models, namely\nBERT and MentalBERT. Specifically, the proposed approach employs a Multimodal\nAdaptation Gate for creating the combined embeddings, which are given as input\nto a BERT (or MentalBERT) model. For taking into account the model calibration,\nwe apply label smoothing. We test our proposed approaches in three publicly\navailable datasets and demonstrate that the integration of linguistic features\ninto transformer-based models presents a surge in the performance. Also, the\nusage of label smoothing contributes to both the improvement of the model's\nperformance and the calibration of the model. We finally perform a linguistic\nanalysis of the posts and show differences in language between stressful and\nnon-stressful texts, as well as depressive and non-depressive posts.",

Such a system would not\ngenerate its own gravitational field. To check if suchsystems may exist we find\na relationship between the stress tensor and the Euler operator. We prove that\nif a system of n interacting scalar fields (n cannot exceed the spacetime\ndimension d) or a single vector field (if d is even) has the stress tensor such\nthat its divergence is identically zero (\"on and off shell\"), then the Lagrange\nequations of motion hold identically too. These systems are unphysical as\nhaving no propagation equations at all. Thus nontrivial field equations imply\nthe nontrivial stress tensor. The theorem breaks down if the of the field\ncomponents n is greater than d. We show that for n>d matter systems without\nenergy and their own gravity (and yet detectable) are in principle admissible.\nTheir equations of motion are degenerate.

Here, we further extend upon the evolutionary synthesis\nstrategy for achieving efficient feature extraction via the introduction of a\nstress-induced evolutionary synthesis framework, where stress signals are\nimposed upon the synapses of a deep neural network during training to induce\nstress and steer the synthesis process towards the production of more efficient\ndeep neural networks over successive generations and improved model fidelity at\na greater efficiency. The proposed stress-induced evolutionary synthesis\napproach is evaluated on a variety of different deep neural network\narchitectures (LeNet5, AlexNet, and YOLOv2) on different tasks (object\nclassification and object detection) to synthesize efficient StressedNets over\nmultiple generations. Experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of the\nproposed framework to synthesize StressedNets with significant improvement in\nnetwork architecture efficiency (e.g., 40x for AlexNet and 33x for YOLOv2) and\nspeed improvements (e.g., 5.5x inference speed-up for YOLOv2 on an Nvidia Tegra\nX1 mobile processor).",

The Young modulus parallel to bedding\nwas about 1.8 times higher than the one perpendicular to the bedding plane. A\nnotably low Poisson ratio perpendicular to the bedding plane with values\nbetween 0.1 and 0.2 was evidenced.

Using all determined\nparameters in a least square error regression scheme, seven independent elastic\ncoefficients and their effective stress dependency are characterized.\nParameters measured under isotropic loading are well represented by this set of\ncoefficients, while the poroelastic framework with isotropic stress dependency\nis not sufficient to describe laboratory findings from triaxial loading.",

    "abstract": "Electromigration (EM) is a key reliability issue in deeply scaled technology\nnodes. Traditional EM methods first filter immortal wires using the Blech\ncriterion, and then perform EM analysis based on Black's equation on the\nremaining wires. The Blech criterion is based on finding the steady-state\nstress in a two-terminal wire segment, but most on-chip structures are\nconsiderably more complex. Current-density-based assessment methodologies,\ni.e., Black's equation and the Blech criterion, which are predominantly used to\ndetect EM-susceptible wires, do not capture the physics of EM, but alternative\nphysics-based methods involve the solution of differential equations and are\nslow. This paper uses first principles, based on solving fundamental stress\nequations that relate electron wind and back-stress forces to the stress\nevolution in an interconnect, and devises a technique that analyzes any general\ntree or mesh interconnect structure to test for immortality. The resulting\nsolution is extremely computationally efficient and its computation time is\nlinear in the number of metal segments. Two variants of the method are\nproposed: a current-density-based method that requires traversals of the\ninterconnect graph, and a voltage-based formulation negates the need for any\ntraversals. The methods are applied to large interconnect networks for\ndetermining the steady-state stress at all nodes and test all segments of each\nnetwork for immortality. The proposed model is applied to a variety of tree and\nmesh structures and is demonstrated to be fast. By construction, it is an exact\nsolution and it is demonstrated to match much more computationally expensive\nnumerical simulations.",

Distinguishing\nnegative emotions of similar valence could be important in contexts such as\nmental health. This project proposes a semi-supervised machine learning model\n(DASentimental) to extract depression, anxiety and stress from written text.\nFirst, we trained the model to spot how sequences of recalled emotion words by\n$N=200$ individuals correlated with their responses to the Depression Anxiety\nStress Scale (DASS-21). Within the framework of cognitive network science, we\nmodel every list of recalled emotions as a walk over a networked mental\nrepresentation of semantic memory, with emotions connected according to free\nassociations in people's memory. Among several tested machine learning\napproaches, we find that a multilayer perceptron neural network trained on word\nsequences and semantic network distances can achieve state-of-art,\ncross-validated predictions for depression ($R = 0.7$), anxiety ($R = 0.44$)\nand stress ($R = 0.52$). Though limited by sample size, this first-of-its-kind\napproach enables quantitative explorations of key semantic dimensions behind\nDAS levels. We find that semantic distances between recalled emotions and the\ndyad \"sad-happy\" are crucial features for estimating depression levels but are\nless important for anxiety and stress. We also find that semantic distance of\nrecalls from \"fear\" can boost the prediction of anxiety but it becomes\nredundant when the \"sad-happy\" dyad is considered. Adopting DASentimental as a\nsemi-supervised learning tool to estimate DAS in text, we apply it to a dataset\nof 142 suicide notes. We conclude by discussing key directions for future\nresearch enabled by artificial intelligence detecting stress, anxiety and\ndepression.",

A modified version of a standard ECG circuit was utilized to provide\nproper loading, noise rejection, filtering, and phase of the TENG signals along\nwith multiplexing of the many electrodes.

Testing of the device was conducted\nutilizing an Arduino Uno and an EVAL-AD5940BIOZ evaluation board for\nelectrodermal activity for stress and/or pain after exercise. An accelerometer\nwas included for device activation and hand tremor detection. Upon testing, the\nself-powered TENG sensors produce positive impulses upon contact and negative\nimpulses upon release of contact from the surface of the ball. Furthermore,\nfinger removal detection was demonstrated by capturing the associated negative\nimpulse by maintaining the bipolar signal in our conditioning circuit. EDA\nresults indicate silver-coated nylon as a potentially good dry-electrode which\ncan be used with even more electrodes for bio-impedance or ECG capture to\nfurther expand the device functionality. A MATLAB-based GUI was designed to\nprovide the user with data tracking and visual monitoring of the data via\nserial communication from the microcontrollers.

Despite a significant effect on viability (LD50), TiO2 NPs had no\ndetectable effect on the proteomic pattern, while ZnO NPs and ZnSO4\nsignificantly modified B. subtilis metabolism. These results allowed us to\nconclude that the effects of ZnO observed in this work were mainly attributable\nto Zn dissolution in the culture media.

Biochemical assays, such as free\nsulfhydryl, CoA-SH and malate dehydrogenase assays corroborated the observed\ncentral metabolism reorientation and showed that Zn stress induced oxidative\nstress, probably as a consequence of thiol chelation stress by Zn ions. The\nother patterns affected by ZnO and ZnSO4 were the stringent response and the\ngeneral stress response. Nine proteins involved in or controlled by the\nstringent response showed a modified expression profile in the presence of ZnO\nNPs or ZnSO4: YwaC, SigH, YtxH, YtzB, TufA, RplJ, RpsB, PdhB and Mbl.

Such tests rely sensitively on the phase\nevolution of the gravitational waves, which is controlled by the\nenergy-momentum carried by such waves out of the system. We here study four\ndifferent methods for finding the gravitational wave stress-energy\npseudo-tensor in gravity theories with any combination of scalar, vector, or\ntensor degrees of freedom. These methods rely on the second variation of the\naction under short-wavelength averaging, the second perturbation of the field\nequations in the short-wavelength approximation, the construction of an energy\ncomplex leading to a Landau-Lifshitz tensor, and the use of Noether's theorem\nin field theories about a flat background. We apply these methods in General\nRelativity, scalar-tensor theories and Einstein-\\AE{}ther theory to find the\ngravitational wave stress-energy pseudo-tensor and calculate the rate at which\nenergy and linear momentum is carried away from the system. The stress-energy\ntensor and the rate of linear momentum loss in Einstein-\\AE{}ther theory are\npresented here for the first time. We find that all methods yield the same rate\nof energy loss, although the stress-energy pseudo-tensor can be functionally\ndifferent. We also find that the Noether method yields a stress-energy tensor\nthat is not symmetric or gauge-invariant, and symmetrization via the Belinfante\nprocedure does not fix these problems because this procedure relies on Lorentz\ninvariance, which is spontaneously broken in Einstein-\\AE{}ther theory. The\nmethods and results found here will be useful for the calculation of\npredictions in modified gravity theories that can then be contrasted with\nobservations.",

The shear stress is partitioned\nbetween a component due to shear in the current, which is reduced at low\nturbulent Langmuir number ($La_t$), and a wave-induced component, which decays\nover a depth proportional to the dominant wavelength. The model reproduces the\napparent reduction of the friction velocity and enhancement of the roughness\nlength estimated from current profiles, detected in a number of studies. These\neffects are predicted to intensify as $La_t$ decreases, and are entirely\nattributed to non-breaking surface waves.

Comparisons of the model with the comprehensive\ndataset provided by the laboratory experiments of Cheung and Street show\nencouraging agreement, with the current speed decreasing as the wind speed\nincreases (corresponding to decreasing $La_t$), if the model is adjusted to\nreflect the effects of a full wave spectrum on the intensity and depth of\npenetration of the wave-induced stress.

    "abstract": "In this numerical study areas of the carotid bifurcation and of a distal\nstenosis in the internal carotid artery are closely observed to evaluate the\npatient's current risks of ischemic stroke. An indicator for the vessel wall\ndefects is the stress the blood is exerting on the surrounding vessel tissue,\nexpressed standardly by the amplitude of the wall shear stress vector (WSS) and\nits oscillatory shear index. In contrast, our orientation-based shear\nevaluation detects negative shear stresses corresponding with reversal flow\nappearing in low shear areas. In our investigations of longitudinal component\nof the wall shear vector, tangential vectors aligned longitudinally with the\nvessel are necessary. However, as a result of stenosed regions and imaging\nsegmentation techniques from patients' CTA scans, the geometry model's mesh is\nnon-smooth on its surface areas and the automatically generated tangential\nvector field is discontinuous and multi-directional, making an interpretation\nof the orientation-based risk indicators unreliable. We improve the evaluation\nof longitudinal shear stress by applying the projection of the vessel's\ncenter-line to the surface to construct smooth tangetial field aligned\nlongitudinaly with the vessel. We validate our approach for the longitudinal\nWSS component and the corresponding oscillatory index by comparing them to\nresults obtained using automatically generated tangents in both rigid and\nelastic vessel modeling as well as to amplitude based indicators. The major\nbenefit of our WSS evaluation based on its longitudinal component for the\ncardiovascular risk assessment is the detection of negative WSS indicating\npersitent reversal flow. This is impossible in the case of the amplitude-based\nWSS.",

However; patients often experience their most severe PTSD\nsymptoms outside of therapy sessions. Mobile health applications may address\nthis gap, but their effectiveness is limited by the current gap in continuous\nmonitoring and detection capabilities enabling timely intervention. The goal of\nthis article is to develop a novel method to detect hyperarousal events using\nphysiological and activity-based machine learning algorithms. Physiological\ndata including heart rate and body acceleration as well as self-reported\nhyperarousal events were collected using a tool developed for commercial\noff-the-shelf wearable devices from 99 United States veterans diagnosed with\nPTSD over several days. The data were used to develop four machine learning\nalgorithms: Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, Logistic Regression and\nXGBoost. The XGBoost model had the best performance in detecting onset of PTSD\nsymptoms with over 83% accuracy and an AUC of 0.70. Post-hoc SHapley Additive\nexPlanations (SHAP) additive explanation analysis showed that algorithm\npredictions were correlated with average heart rate, minimum heart rate and\naverage body acceleration. Findings show promise in detecting onset of PTSD\nsymptoms which could be the basis for developing remote and continuous\nmonitoring systems for PTSD.

    "abstract": "A large number of tidal disruption event (TDE) candidates have been observed\nrecently, often differing in their observational features. Two classes appear\nto stand out: X-ray and optical TDEs, the latter featuring lower effective\ntemperatures and luminosities. These differences can be explained if the\nradiation detected from the two categories of events originates from different\nlocations. In practice, this location is set by the evolution of the debris\nstream around the black hole and by the energy dissipation associated with it.\nIn this paper, we build an analytical model for the stream evolution, whose\ndynamics is determined by both magnetic stresses and shocks. Without magnetic\nstresses, the stream always circularizes. The ratio of the circularization\ntimescale to the initial stream period is $t_{\\rm ev}/t_{\\rm min} = 8.3 (M_{\\rm\nh}/10^6 M_{\\odot})^{-5/3} \\beta^{-3}$, where $M_{\\rm h}$ is the black hole mass\nand $\\beta$ is the penetration factor. If magnetic stresses are strong, they\ncan lead to the stream ballistic accretion. The boundary between\ncircularization and ballistic accretion corresponds to a critical magnetic\nstresses efficiency $v_{\\rm A}/v_{\\rm c} \\approx 10^{-1}$, largely independent\nof $M_{\\rm h}$ and $\\beta$. However, the main effect of magnetic stresses is to\naccelerate the stream evolution by strengthening self-crossing shocks.\nBallistic accretion therefore necessarily occurs on the stream dynamical\ntimescale. The shock luminosity associated to energy dissipation is\nsub-Eddington but decays as $t^{-5/3}$ only for a slow stream evolution.\nFinally, we find that the stream thickness rapidly increases if the stream is\nunable to cool completely efficiently. A likely outcome is its fast evolution\ninto a thick torus, or even an envelope completely surrounding the black hole.",

The stress distribution with latitude is confirmed qualitatively when\ntaking into account the comet's complex shape but neglecting thermal inertia.\nStress is found to be comparable to the material strength everywhere for\nsufficient thermal inertia ($\\gtrsim50$ J m$^{-2}$ K$^{-1}$ s$^{-1/2}$) and ice\ncontent ($\\gtrsim 45\\%$ at the equator). In this case, stresses penetrate to a\ntypical depth of $\\sim0.25$ m, consistent with the detection of metre-scale\nthermal contraction crack polygons all over the comet.

In cellular learning nodes of\nsignalling networks strengthen their interactions e.g. by the conformational\nmemory of intrinsically disordered proteins, protein translocation, miRNAs,\nlncRNAs, chromatin memory and signalling cascades. This can be described by a\ngeneralized, unicellular Hebbian learning process, where those signalling\nconnections, which participate in learning, become stronger. Here we review\nthose scenarios, where cellular signalling is not only repeated in a few times\n(when learning occurs), but becomes too frequent, too large, or too complex and\noverloads the cell. This leads to desensitisation of signalling networks by\ndecoupling signalling components, receptor internalization, and consequent\ndownregulation. These molecular processes are examples of anti-Hebbian learning\nand forgetting of signalling networks. Stress can be perceived as signalling\noverload inducing the desensitisation of signalling pathways. Aging occurs by\nthe summative effects of cumulative stress downregulating signalling. We\npropose that cellular learning desensitisation, stress and aging may be placed\nalong the same axis of more and more intensive (prolonged or repeated)\nsignalling. We discuss how cells might discriminate between repeated and\nunexpected signals, and highlight the Hebbian and anti-Hebbian mechanisms\nbehind the fold-change detection in the NF-\\k{appa}B signalling pathway. We\nlist drug design methods using Hebbian learning (such as chemically-induced\nproximity) and clinical treatment modalities inducing (cancer, drug allergies)\ndesensitisation or avoiding drug-induced desensitisation.

In this work we model threshold-activated avalanche dynamics and\ninvestigate the time required to detect local variations in the ability of\nmodel elements to bear stress. We show that the detection time follows a\nscaling law where the scaling exponents depend on whether the feature that is\nsought is either weaker, or stronger, than its surroundings. We then look at\nearthquake data from Sumatra and California, demonstrate the trade-off between\nthe spatial resolution of a map of earthquake exponents i.e. the $b$-values of\nthe Gutenberg-Richter law) and the accuracy of those exponents, and suggest a\nmeans to maximise both.",

Results confirm that this approach works well for classifying\nroof conditions as hazardous or safe, achieving a statistical accuracy of 86%.\nHowever, accuracy alone is not enough to ensure a reliable hazard management\nsystem. System constraints and reliability are improved when the features being\nused by the network are understood. Therefore, we used a deep learning\ninterpretation technique called integrated gradients to identify the important\ngeologic features in each image for prediction. The analysis of integrated\ngradients shows that the system mimics expert judgment on roof fall hazard\ndetection.

It is also possible to consider, for pairwise\ninteraction potentials, as the minimal elements of stress, the stress tensors\nassociated with the pairs of interacting particles. From this perspective, the\natomic level stress is not the minimal stress element, but a sum of all pair\nstress elements in which involved a selected particle. In this paper, we\nconsider the Green-Kubo stress correlation function from a microscopic\nperspective using the stress tensors of interacting pairs as the basic stress\nelements. The obtained results show the presence of a long-range\nbond-orientational order in the studied model liquid and naturally elucidate\nthe connection of the bond-orientational order with viscosity. It turns out\nthat the long-range bond-orientational order is more clearly expressed in the\npairs' stress correlation function than in the atomic stress correlation\nfunction. On the other hand, previously observed stress waves are much better\nexpressed in the atomic stress correlation functions. We also address the close\nconnection of our approach with the previous bond-orientational order\nconsiderations. Finally, we consider the probability distributions for the\nbond-stress and atomic stress correlation products at selected distances. The\ncharacter of the obtained probability distributions raises questions about the\nmeaning of the average correlation functions at large distances.",

We\nstress, and quantify by simple formulas, that the primary CMB anisotropies are\nvery susceptible to the gravitational potentials during horizon entry, less at\nrecombination. The CMB thus allows us to scan \\Phi+\\Psi and the underlying dark\nkinetics for all redshifts z~1-10^5. LSS, on the other hand, responds strongest\nto \\Phi at low redshifts. Dark perturbations are often parameterized by the\nanisotropic stress and effective sound speed (stiffness). We find that the dark\nanisotropic stress and stiffness influence the visible species at the\ncorrespondingly early and late stages of horizon entry, and affect stronger\nrespectively the CMB and LSS. The CMB yet remains essential to probing the\nstiff perturbations of light neutrinos and dark energy, detectable only during\nhorizon entry. The clustering of dark species and large propagation speed of\ntheir inhomogeneities also map to distinctive features in the CMB and LSS. -Any\nparameterization of the signatures of dark kinetics that assumes general\nrelativity can effectively accommodate any modified gravity (MG) that retains\nthe equivalence principle for the visible sectors. This implies that formally\nthe nonstandard structure growth or \\Phi/\\Psi ratio, while indicative, are not\ndefinitive MG signatures. The definitive signatures of MG may include the\nstrong dependence of the apparent dark dynamics on visible species, its\nsuperluminality, and the nonstandard phenomenology of gravitational waves.",

Therefore, our objective in this review is to overview the current\nattempts to understand the underlying mechanisms in nanoresonator-based\ndetection using physical models coupled to computational simulations and/or\nexperiments. Specifically, we will focus on issues of special relevance to the\ndynamic behavior of nanoresonators and their applications in\nbiological/chemical detection. We additionally provide extensive discussion\nregarding potentially fruitful future research directions coupling experiments\nand simulations in order to develop a fundamental understanding of the basic\nphysical principles that govern NEMS and NEMS-based sensing applications.",

HD88133 and ups And both have fairly large stellar radii, which\ncontributed to the difficulty in detecting the planets. We take this\nopportunity to consider how these planets may have been detectable with the\nsmall number of epochs originally presented by running simulations both with\nthe upgraded NIRSPEC instrument and with near-zero primary velocities, as\nrecommended by Buzard et al. 2021. While 7 $L$ band NIRSPEC2.0 epochs with\nnear-zero primary velocities would have allowed a strong ($10.8\\sigma$)\ndetection of ups And b, many more than 6 $L$ band epochs would have been\nrequired for a strong detection of HD88133b, which could be due in part to both\nthis system's large stellar radius and low stellar temperature.

In this paper, we stress-test the\nrobustness of these AI text detectors in the presence of an attacker. We\nintroduce recursive paraphrasing attack to stress test a wide range of\ndetection schemes, including the ones using the watermarking as well as neural\nnetwork-based detectors, zero shot classifiers, and retrieval-based detectors.\nOur experiments conducted on passages, each approximately 300 tokens long,\nreveal the varying sensitivities of these detectors to our attacks. Our\nfindings indicate that while our recursive paraphrasing method can\nsignificantly reduce detection rates, it only slightly degrades text quality in\nmany cases, highlighting potential vulnerabilities in current detection systems\nin the presence of an attacker. Additionally, we investigate the susceptibility\nof watermarked LLMs to spoofing attacks aimed at misclassifying human-written\ntext as AI-generated.

    "abstract": "Granular materials transmit stress via a network of force chains. Despite the\nimportance of these chains to characterizing the stress state and dynamics of\nthe system, there is no common framework for quantifying their their\nproperties. Recently, attention has turned to the tools of network science as a\npromising route to such a description. In this paper, we apply community\ndetection techniques to numerically-generated packings of spheres over a range\nof interparticle friction coefficients and confining pressures. In order to\nextract chain-like features, we use a modularity maximization with a\nrecently-developed geographical null model \\cite{Bassett2015}, and optimize the\ntechnique to detect branched structures by minimizing the normalized convex\nhull of the detected communities. We characterize the force chain communities\nby their size (number of particles), network strength (internal forces), and\nnormalized convex hull ratio (sparseness). We find the that the first two\nexhibit an approximately linear correlation and are therefore largely\nredundant. For both pressure $P$ and interparticle friction $\\mu$, we observe\ncrossovers in behavior. For $\\mu \\lesssim 0.1$, the packings exhibit more\nsensitivity to pressure. In addition, we identify a crossover pressure where\nthe frictional dependence switches from having more large/strong communities at\nlow $\\mu$ vs. high $\\mu$. We explain these phenomena by comparison to the\nspatial distribution of communities along the vertical axis of the system.\nThese results provide new tools for considering the mesoscale structure of a\ngranular system and pave the way for reduced descriptions based on the force\nchain structure.",

Using the\nstress function method, we find modified stress functions for all six types of\nVolterra defects (dislocations and disclinations) situated in an isotropic and\ninfinitely extended medium. By means of these stress functions, we obtain exact\nanalytical solutions for the stress and strain fields of dislocations and\ndisclinations.

The stresses and strains\nare either zero or have a finite maximum value at the defect line. The maximum\nvalue of stresses may serve as a measure of the critical stress level when\nfracture and failure may occur.

It is stressed that the dominant\nfactor is the time evolution of the laser pulse, which causes tensile stresses\nand acoustic waves. The study is supported by experimental realization of\nelectrostriction, which can be detected only at favourable conditions (observed\nin water, but not in castor oil).

Most previous\nworks in the artificial intelligence field focus on recognizing emotion rather\nthan mining the reason why emotions are not or wrongly recognized. Correlation\namong emotions contributes to the failure of emotion recognition. In this\npaper, we try to fill the gap between emotion recognition and emotion\ncorrelation mining through natural language text from web news. Correlation\namong emotions, expressed as the confusion and evolution of emotion, is\nprimarily caused by human emotion cognitive bias. To mine emotion correlation\nfrom emotion recognition through text, three kinds of features and two deep\nneural network models are presented. The emotion confusion law is extracted\nthrough orthogonal basis. The emotion evolution law is evaluated from three\nperspectives, one-step shift, limited-step shifts, and shortest path transfer.\nThe method is validated using three datasets-the titles, the bodies, and the\ncomments of news articles, covering both objective and subjective texts in\nvarying lengths (long and short). The experimental results show that, in\nsubjective comments, emotions are easily mistaken as anger. Comments tend to\narouse emotion circulations of love-anger and sadness-anger. In objective news,\nit is easy to recognize text emotion as love and cause fear-joy circulation.\nThat means, journalists may try to attract attention using fear and joy words\nbut arouse the emotion love instead; After news release, netizens generate\nemotional comments to express their intense emotions, i.e., anger, sadness, and\nlove. These findings could provide insights for applications regarding\naffective interaction such as network public sentiment, social media\ncommunication, and human-computer interaction.",

The high quality of naturalistic emotional speech\ndata is the basis of this research. The following techniques are used for\ninducing practical emotional speech: cognitive task, computer game, noise\nstimulation, sleep deprivation and movie clips.\n  A practical speech emotion recognition system is studied based on Gaussian\nmixture model. A two-class classifier set is adopted for performance\nimprovement under the small sample case. Considering the context information in\ncontinuous emotional speech, a Gaussian mixture model embedded with Markov\nnetworks is proposed.\n  A further study is carried out for system robustness analysis. First, noise\nreduction algorithm based on auditory masking properties is fist introduced to\nthe practical speech emotion recognition. Second, to deal with the complicated\nunknown emotion types under real situation, an emotion recognition method with\nrejection ability is proposed, which enhanced the system compatibility against\nunknown emotion samples. Third, coping with the difficulties brought by a large\nnumber of unknown speakers, an emotional feature normalization method based on\nspeaker-sensitive feature clustering is proposed. Fourth, by adding the\nelectrocardiogram channel, a bi-modal emotion recognition system based on\nspeech signals and electrocardiogram signals is first introduced.\n  The speech emotion recognition methods studied in this dissertation may be\nextended into the cross-language speech emotion recognition and the whispered\nspeech emotion recognition.",

Besides, the proposed MES-P dataset features emotion\nintensity variations as well, and includes both moderate and intense versions\nof recordings for joy, anger, and sadness in addition to neutral speech.\nRatings of the collected speech samples are made in valence-arousal space\nthrough continuous coordinate locations, resulting in an emotional distribution\npattern in 2D VA space.

It is a significant technical\nchallenge since humans display their emotions through complex idiosyncratic\ncombinations of the language, visual and acoustic modalities. In contrast to\ntraditional multimodal fusion techniques, we approach emotion recognition from\nboth direct person-independent and relative person-dependent perspectives. The\ndirect person-independent perspective follows the conventional emotion\nrecognition approach which directly infers absolute emotion labels from\nobserved multimodal features. The relative person-dependent perspective\napproaches emotion recognition in a relative manner by comparing partial video\nsegments to determine if there was an increase or decrease in emotional\nintensity. Our proposed model integrates these direct and relative prediction\nperspectives by dividing the emotion recognition task into three easier\nsubtasks. The first subtask involves a multimodal local ranking of relative\nemotion intensities between two short segments of a video. The second subtask\nuses local rankings to infer global relative emotion ranks with a Bayesian\nranking algorithm. The third subtask incorporates both direct predictions from\nobserved multimodal behaviors and relative emotion ranks from local-global\nrankings for final emotion prediction.

To date, emotional coherence (EC) has been\nstudied at a single time point using lab-based tasks with relatively small\ndatasets. No study has examined EC between the subjective experience of\nemotions and emotion expression in therapy or whether this coherence is\nassociated with clients' well being. Natural language Processing (NLP)\napproaches have been applied to identify emotions from psychotherapy dialogue,\nwhich can be implemented to study emotional processes on a larger scale.\nHowever, these methods have yet to be used to study coherence between emotional\nexperience and emotional expression over the course of therapy and whether it\nrelates to clients' well-being. This work presents an end-to-end approach where\nwe use emotion predictions from our transformer based emotion recognition model\nto study emotional coherence and its diagnostic potential in psychotherapy\nresearch. We first employ our transformer based approach on a Hebrew\npsychotherapy dataset to automatically label clients' emotions at utterance\nlevel in psychotherapy dialogues. We subsequently investigate the emotional\ncoherence between clients' self-reported emotional states and our model-based\nemotion predictions.

One of the four major topics in affective\ncomputing is computers that have emotions (the others are recognizing,\nexpressing and understanding emotions). A critical and neglected aspect of\nhaving emotions is the experience of emotion (Barrett, Mesquita, Ochsner, and\nGross, 2007): what does the content of an emotional episode look like, how does\nthis content change over time and when do we call the episode emotional.

This could, however, be considered overly sophisticated\nif the main question to answer is who feels which emotion. A targeted approach\nfor such setup is to classify emotion experiencer mentions (aka \"emoters\")\nregarding the emotion they presumably perceive.

    "abstract": "Emotion recognition or detection is broadly utilized in patient-doctor\ninteractions for diseases such as schizophrenia and autism and the most typical\ntechniques are speech detection and facial recognition. However, features\nextracted from these behavior-based emotion recognitions are not reliable since\nhumans can disguise their emotions. Recording voices or tracking facial\nexpressions for a long term is also not efficient. Therefore, our aim is to\nfind a reliable and efficient emotion recognition scheme, which can be used for\nnon-behavior-based emotion recognition in real-time. This can be solved by\nimplementing a single-channel electrocardiogram (ECG) based emotion recognition\nscheme in a lightweight embedded system. However, existing schemes have\nrelatively low accuracy. Therefore, we propose a reliable and efficient emotion\nrecognition scheme - exploitative and explorative grey wolf optimizer based SVM\n(X - GWO - SVM) for ECG-based emotion recognition. Two datasets, one raw\nself-collected iRealcare dataset, and the widely-used benchmark WESAD dataset\nare used in the X - GWO - SVM algorithm for emotion recognition. This work\ndemonstrates that the X - GWO - SVM algorithm can be used for emotion\nrecognition and the algorithm exhibits superior performance in reliability\ncompared to the use of other supervised machine learning methods in earlier\nworks. It can be implemented in a lightweight embedded system, which is much\nmore efficient than existing solutions based on deep neural networks.",

Extant approaches employ each modality equally without distinguishing the\namount of emotional information in these modalities, rendering it hard to\nadequately extract complementary information from multimodal data. To cope with\nthis problem, in CFN-ESA, we treat textual modality as the primary source of\nemotional information, while visual and acoustic modalities are taken as the\nsecondary sources. Besides, most multimodal ERC models ignore emotion-shift\ninformation and overfocus on contextual information, leading to the failure of\nemotion recognition under emotion-shift scenario. We elaborate an emotion-shift\nmodule to address this challenge. CFN-ESA mainly consists of unimodal encoder\n(RUME), cross-modal encoder (ACME), and emotion-shift module (LESM). RUME is\napplied to extract conversation-level contextual emotional cues while pulling\ntogether data distributions between modalities; ACME is utilized to perform\nmultimodal interaction centered on textual modality; LESM is used to model\nemotion shift and capture emotion-shift information, thereby guiding the\nlearning of the main task.

    "abstract": "Recently, emotional talking face generation has received considerable\nattention. However, existing methods only adopt one-hot coding, image, or audio\nas emotion conditions, thus lacking flexible control in practical applications\nand failing to handle unseen emotion styles due to limited semantics. They\neither ignore the one-shot setting or the quality of generated faces. In this\npaper, we propose a more flexible and generalized framework. Specifically, we\nsupplement the emotion style in text prompts and use an Aligned Multi-modal\nEmotion encoder to embed the text, image, and audio emotion modality into a\nunified space, which inherits rich semantic prior from CLIP. Consequently,\neffective multi-modal emotion space learning helps our method support arbitrary\nemotion modality during testing and could generalize to unseen emotion styles.\nBesides, an Emotion-aware Audio-to-3DMM Convertor is proposed to connect the\nemotion condition and the audio sequence to structural representation. A\nfollowed style-based High-fidelity Emotional Face generator is designed to\ngenerate arbitrary high-resolution realistic identities. Our texture generator\nhierarchically learns flow fields and animated faces in a residual manner.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate the flexibility and generalization of our\nmethod in emotion control and the effectiveness of high-quality face synthesis.",

    "abstract": "Emotion estimation in images is a challenging task, typically using computer\nvision methods to directly estimate people's emotions using face, body pose and\ncontextual cues. In this paper, we explore whether Large Language Models (LLMs)\ncan support the contextual emotion estimation task, by first captioning images,\nthen using an LLM for inference. First, we must understand: how well do LLMs\nperceive human emotions? And which parts of the information enable them to\ndetermine emotions? One initial challenge is to construct a caption that\ndescribes a person within a scene with information relevant for emotion\nperception. Towards this goal, we propose a set of natural language descriptors\nfor faces, bodies, interactions, and environments. We use them to manually\ngenerate captions and emotion annotations for a subset of 331 images from the\nEMOTIC dataset. These captions offer an interpretable representation for\nemotion estimation, towards understanding how elements of a scene affect\nemotion perception in LLMs and beyond. Secondly, we test the capability of a\nlarge language model to infer an emotion from the resulting image captions. We\nfind that GPT-3.5, specifically the text-davinci-003 model, provides\nsurprisingly reasonable emotion predictions consistent with human annotations,\nbut accuracy can depend on the emotion concept. Overall, the results suggest\npromise in the image captioning and LLM approach.",

Emotions do not last long, yet they need enough context to be perceived\nand felt. However, most EEG-related emotion databases either suffer from\nemotionally irrelevant details (due to prolonged duration stimulus) or have\nminimal context doubting the feeling of any emotion using the stimulus. We\ntried to reduce the impact of this trade-off by designing an experiment in\nwhich participants are free to report their emotional feelings simultaneously\nwatching the emotional stimulus. We called these reported emotional feelings\n\"Emotional Events\" in our Dataset on Emotion with Naturalistic Stimuli (DENS).\nWe used EEG signals to classify emotional events on different combinations of\nValence(V) and Arousal(A) dimensions and compared the results with benchmark\ndatasets of DEAP and SEED. STFT is used for feature extraction and used in the\nclassification model consisting of CNN-LSTM hybrid layers.

Although most empirical studies have been\ndominated by two theoretical models including discrete categories of emotion\nand dichotomous dimensions, results from neuroscience approaches suggest a\nmulti-processes mechanism underpinning emotional experience with a large\noverlap across different emotions. While these findings are consistent with the\ninfluential theories of emotion in psychology that emphasize a role for\nmultiple component processes to generate emotion episodes, few studies have\nsystematically investigated the relationship between discrete emotions and a\nfull componential view. This paper applies a componential framework with a\ndata-driven approach to characterize emotional experiences evoked during movie\nwatching. The results suggest that differences between various emotions can be\ncaptured by a few (at least 6) latent dimensions, each defined by features\nassociated with component processes, including appraisal, expression,\nphysiology, motivation, and feeling. In addition, the link between discrete\nemotions and component model is explored and results show that a componential\nmodel with a limited number of descriptors is still able to predict the level\nof experienced discrete emotion(s) to a satisfactory level. Finally, as\nappraisals may vary according to individual dispositions and biases, we also\nstudy the relationship between personality traits and emotions in our\ncomputational framework and show that the role of personality on discrete\nemotion differences can be better justified using the component model.",

    "abstract": "Speech emotions are crucial in human communication and are extensively used\nin fields like speech synthesis and natural language understanding. Most prior\nstudies, such as speech emotion recognition, have categorized speech emotions\ninto a fixed set of classes. Yet, emotions expressed in human speech are often\ncomplex, and categorizing them into predefined groups can be insufficient to\nadequately represent speech emotions. On the contrary, describing speech\nemotions directly by means of natural language may be a more effective\napproach. Regrettably, there are not many studies available that have focused\non this direction. Therefore, this paper proposes a speech emotion captioning\nframework named SECap, aiming at effectively describing speech emotions using\nnatural language. Owing to the impressive capabilities of large language models\nin language comprehension and text generation, SECap employs LLaMA as the text\ndecoder to allow the production of coherent speech emotion captions. In\naddition, SECap leverages HuBERT as the audio encoder to extract general speech\nfeatures and Q-Former as the Bridge-Net to provide LLaMA with emotion-related\nspeech features.

The results of objective and subjective evaluations demonstrate that:\n1) the SECap framework outperforms the HTSAT-BART baseline in all objective\nevaluations; 2) SECap can generate high-quality speech emotion captions that\nattain performance on par with human annotators in subjective mean opinion\nscore tests.",

    "abstract": "This paper proposes a feature-based domain adaptation technique for\nidentifying emotions in generic images, encompassing both facial and non-facial\nobjects, as well as non-human components. This approach addresses the challenge\nof the limited availability of pre-trained models and well-annotated datasets\nfor Image Emotion Recognition (IER). Initially, a deep-learning-based Facial\nExpression Recognition (FER) system is developed, classifying facial images\ninto discrete emotion classes. Maintaining the same network architecture, this\nFER system is then adapted to recognize emotions in generic images through the\napplication of discrepancy loss, enabling the model to effectively learn IER\nfeatures while classifying emotions into categories such as 'happy,' 'sad,'\n'hate,' and 'anger.' Additionally, a novel interpretability method, Divide and\nConquer based Shap (DnCShap), is introduced to elucidate the visual features\nmost relevant for emotion recognition. The proposed IER system demonstrated\nemotion classification accuracies of 61.86% for the IAPSa dataset, 62.47 for\nthe ArtPhoto dataset, 70.78% for the FI dataset, and 59.72% for the EMOTIC\ndataset. The system effectively identifies the important visual features that\nlead to specific emotion classifications and also provides detailed embedding\nplots explaining the predictions, enhancing the understanding and trust in\nAI-driven emotion recognition systems.",

The approach is based on standard speech\nrecognition technology using hidden continuous markov model by selection of low\nlevel features and the design of the recognition system. Emotional Speech\nDatabase from Telugu Rural Dialects of Andhra Pradesh (TRDAP) was designed\nusing several speaker's voices comprising the emotional states.

    "abstract": "Emotional talking head generation has attracted growing attention. Previous\nmethods, which are mainly GAN-based, still struggle to consistently produce\nsatisfactory results across diverse emotions and cannot conveniently specify\npersonalized emotions. In this work, we leverage powerful diffusion models to\naddress the issue and propose DreamTalk, a framework that employs meticulous\ndesign to unlock the potential of diffusion models in generating emotional\ntalking heads. Specifically, DreamTalk consists of three crucial components: a\ndenoising network, a style-aware lip expert, and a style predictor. The\ndiffusion-based denoising network can consistently synthesize high-quality\naudio-driven face motions across diverse emotions. To enhance lip-motion\naccuracy and emotional fullness, we introduce a style-aware lip expert that can\nguide lip-sync while preserving emotion intensity. To more conveniently specify\npersonalized emotions, a diffusion-based style predictor is utilized to predict\nthe personalized emotion directly from the audio, eliminating the need for\nextra emotion reference. By this means, DreamTalk can consistently generate\nvivid talking faces across diverse emotions and conveniently specify\npersonalized emotions. Extensive experiments validate DreamTalk's effectiveness\nand superiority. The code is available at\nhttps://github.com/ali-vilab/dreamtalk.",

    "abstract": "To be widely adopted, 3D facial avatars must be animated easily,\nrealistically, and directly from speech signals. While the best recent methods\ngenerate 3D animations that are synchronized with the input audio, they largely\nignore the impact of emotions on facial expressions. Realistic facial animation\nrequires lip-sync together with the natural expression of emotion. To that end,\nwe propose EMOTE (Expressive Model Optimized for Talking with Emotion), which\ngenerates 3D talking-head avatars that maintain lip-sync from speech while\nenabling explicit control over the expression of emotion. To achieve this, we\nsupervise EMOTE with decoupled losses for speech (i.e., lip-sync) and emotion.\nThese losses are based on two key observations: (1) deformations of the face\ndue to speech are spatially localized around the mouth and have high temporal\nfrequency, whereas (2) facial expressions may deform the whole face and occur\nover longer intervals. Thus, we train EMOTE with a per-frame lip-reading loss\nto preserve the speech-dependent content, while supervising emotion at the\nsequence level. Furthermore, we employ a content-emotion exchange mechanism in\norder to supervise different emotions on the same audio, while maintaining the\nlip motion synchronized with the speech. To employ deep perceptual losses\nwithout getting undesirable artifacts, we devise a motion prior in the form of\na temporal VAE. Due to the absence of high-quality aligned emotional 3D face\ndatasets with speech, EMOTE is trained with 3D pseudo-ground-truth extracted\nfrom an emotional video dataset (i.e., MEAD). Extensive qualitative and\nperceptual evaluations demonstrate that EMOTE produces speech-driven facial\nanimations with better lip-sync than state-of-the-art methods trained on the\nsame data, while offering additional, high-quality emotional control.",

Previous studies on emotion recognition based on\nelectroencephalography (EEG) signals mainly rely on single-channel-based\nfeature extraction methods. In this paper, we propose a novel emotion-relevant\ncritical subnetwork selection algorithm and investigate three EEG functional\nconnectivity network features: strength, clustering coefficient, and\neigenvector centrality. The discrimination ability of the EEG connectivity\nfeatures in emotion recognition is evaluated on three public emotion EEG\ndatasets: SEED, SEED-V, and DEAP. The strength feature achieves the best\nclassification performance and outperforms the state-of-the-art differential\nentropy feature based on single-channel analysis. The experimental results\nreveal that distinct functional connectivity patterns are exhibited for the\nfive emotions of disgust, fear, sadness, happiness, and neutrality.\nFurthermore, we construct a multimodal emotion recognition model by combining\nthe functional connectivity features from EEG and the features from eye\nmovements or physiological signals using deep canonical correlation analysis.\nThe classification accuracies of multimodal emotion recognition are 95.08/6.42%\non the SEED dataset, 84.51/5.11% on the SEED-V dataset, and 85.34/2.90% and\n86.61/3.76% for arousal and valence on the DEAP dataset, respectively.

Finally, to fully utilize the local emotion information,\nadaptive and multi-level FBP (AMFBP) is introduced by combining both\nglobal-trunk and intratrunk data in one recording on top of AG-FBP.

To solve the problem of cross-dataset EEG emotion recognition, in\nthis paper, we propose an EEG-based Emotion Style Transfer Network (E2STN) to\nobtain EEG representations that contain the content information of source\ndomain and the style information of target domain, which is called stylized\nemotional EEG representations. The representations are helpful for\ncross-dataset discriminative prediction. Concretely, E2STN consists of three\nmodules, i.e., transfer module, transfer evaluation module, and discriminative\nprediction module. The transfer module encodes the domain-specific information\nof source and target domains and then re-constructs the source domain's\nemotional pattern and the target domain's statistical characteristics into the\nnew stylized EEG representations. In this process, the transfer evaluation\nmodule is adopted to constrain the generated representations that can more\nprecisely fuse two kinds of complementary information from source and target\ndomains and avoid distorting. Finally, the generated stylized EEG\nrepresentations are fed into the discriminative prediction module for final\nclassification.

Currently, we have\nidentified 53 known suicidal cases who posted suicide notes on Weibo prior to\ntheir deaths.We explore linguistic features of these known cases using a\npsychological lexicon dictionary, and train an effective suicidal Weibo post\ndetection model. 6714 tagged posts and several classifiers are used to verify\nthe model. By combining both machine learning and psychological knowledge, SVM\nclassifier has the best performance of different classifiers, yielding an\nF-measure of 68:3%, a Precision of 78:9%, and a Recall of 60:3%.",

As the most popular platform for self-expression, emotion\nrelease, and personal interaction, individuals may exhibit a number of symptoms\nof suicidal ideation on social media. Nevertheless, challenges from both data\nand knowledge aspects remain as obstacles, constraining the social media-based\ndetection performance. Data implicitness and sparsity make it difficult to\ndiscover the inner true intentions of individuals based on their posts.\nInspired by psychological studies, we build and unify a high-level\nsuicide-oriented knowledge graph with deep neural networks for suicidal\nideation detection on social media. We further design a two-layered attention\nmechanism to explicitly reason and establish key risk factors to individual's\nsuicidal ideation. The performance study on microblog and Reddit shows that: 1)\nwith the constructed personal knowledge graph, the social media-based suicidal\nideation detection can achieve over 93% accuracy; and 2) among the six\ncategories of personal factors, post, personality, and experience are the top-3\nkey indicators. Under these categories, posted text, stress level, stress\nduration, posted image, and ruminant thinking contribute to one's suicidal\nideation detection.",

Many of the people who have the tendency to suicide share\ntheir thoughts and opinions through social media platforms. As part of many\nresearches it is observed that the publicly available posts from social media\ncontain valuable criteria to effectively detect individuals with suicidal\nthoughts. The most difficult part to prevent suicide is to detect and\nunderstand the complex risk factors and warning signs that may lead to suicide.\nThis can be achieved by identifying the sudden changes in a user behavior\nautomatically. Natural language processing techniques can be used to collect\nbehavioral and textual features from social media interactions and these\nfeatures can be passed to a specially designed framework to detect anomalies in\nhuman interactions that are indicators of suicidal intentions. We can achieve\nfast detection of suicidal ideation using deep learning and/or machine learning\nbased classification approaches. For such a purpose, we can employ the\ncombination of LSTM and CNN models to detect such emotions from posts of the\nusers. In order to improve the accuracy, some approaches like using more data\nfor training, using attention model to improve the efficiency of existing\nmodels etc. could be done. This paper proposes a LSTM-Attention-CNN combined\nmodel to analyze social media submissions to detect any underlying suicidal\nintentions. During evaluations, the proposed model demonstrated an accuracy of\n90.3 percent and an F1-score of 92.6 percent, which is greater than the\nbaseline models.",

Both EHR longitudinal data and EMA question forms\nare defined by asynchronous, variable length, randomly-sampled data sequences.\nIn our method, we model each of them with a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), and\nboth sequences are aligned by concatenating the hidden state of each of them\nusing temporal marks.

This paper describes a novel methodology that identifies suicidality\nin clinical notes by addressing this data sparsity issue through zero-shot\nlearning. U.S. Veterans Affairs clinical notes served as data. The training\ndataset label was determined using diagnostic codes of suicide attempt and\nself-harm. A base string associated with the target label of suicidality was\nused to provide auxiliary information by narrowing the positive training cases\nto those containing the base string. A deep neural network was trained by\nmapping the training documents contents to a semantic space. For comparison, we\ntrained another deep neural network using the identical training dataset labels\nand bag-of-words features. The zero shot learning model outperformed the\nbaseline model in terms of AUC, sensitivity, specificity, and positive\npredictive value at multiple probability thresholds.

While prior artificial intelligence research has demonstrated\nthe ability to extract valuable information from social media on suicidal\nthoughts and behaviors, these efforts have not considered both severity and\ntemporality of risk. The insights made possible by access to such data have\nenormous clinical potential - most dramatically envisioned as a trigger to\nemploy timely and targeted interventions (i.e., voluntary and involuntary\npsychiatric hospitalization) to save lives. In this work, we address this\nknowledge gap by developing deep learning algorithms to assess suicide risk in\nterms of severity and temporality from Reddit data based on the Columbia\nSuicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS). In particular, we employ two deep\nlearning approaches: time-variant and time-invariant modeling, for user-level\nsuicide risk assessment, and evaluate their performance against a\nclinician-adjudicated gold standard Reddit corpus annotated based on the\nC-SSRS. Our results suggest that the time-variant approach outperforms the\ntime-invariant method in the assessment of suicide-related ideations and\nsupportive behaviors (AUC:0.78), while the time-invariant model performed\nbetter in predicting suicide-related behaviors and suicide attempt (AUC:0.64).\nThe proposed approach can be integrated with clinical diagnostic interviews for\nimproving suicide risk assessments.",

To address these gaps, we propose a\nholistic data-driven framework to model the associations of social\n(demographic, socioeconomic) and environmental (climate) factors on suicide\nrates, and study the disparities across urban and suburban areas. Leveraging\nthe county-level suicide data from 2000--2017 along with the\nsocio-environmental features, we trained, tested and validated a suite of\nadvanced statistical learning algorithms to identify, assess and predict the\ninfluence of key socio-environmental factors on suicide rates. Random forest\noutperformed all other models in terms of goodness-of-fit and predictive\naccuracy, and selected as the final model to make inferences. Our results\nindicate that population demographics is significantly associated with both\nurban and suburban suicide rates. We found that suburban population is more\nvulnerable to suicides compared to urban communities, with suburban suicide\nrate being particularly sensitive to unemployment rate and median household\nincome. Our analysis revealed that suicide mortality is correlated to climate,\nshowing that urban suicide rate is more sensitive to higher temperatures,\nseasonal-heating-degree-days and precipitation, while suburban suicide rate is\nsensitive to only seasonal-cooling-degree-days.

We\nused individualized neighbourhoods to examine associations between suicide\nmortality, social fragmentation, and deprivation for the total population as\nwell as by sex and age group. Methods: Using a nested case-control design, all\nsuicides aged 18-64 years between 2007 and 2016 were selected from longitudinal\nDutch register data and matched with 10 random controls. Indices for social\nfragmentation and deprivation were calculated annually for 300, 600, and 1,000\nmetre circular buffers around each subject's residential address. Results:\nSuicide mortality was significantly higher in neighbourhoods with high\ndeprivation and social fragmentation. Accounting for individual characteristics\nlargely attenuated these associations. Suicide mortality remained significantly\nhigher for women living in highly fragmented neighbourhoods in the fully\nadjusted model. Age-stratified analyses indicate associations with\nneighbourhood fragmentation among women in older age groups (40-64 years) only.\nAmong men, suicide risk was lower in fragmented neighbourhoods for\n18-39-year-olds and for short-term residents. In deprived neighbourhoods, the\nsuicide risk was lower for 40-64-year-old men and long-term residents.\nAssociations between neighbourhood characteristics and suicide mortality were\ncomparable across buffer sizes.

    "abstract": "The prevalence of suicide has been on the rise since the 20th century,\ncausing severe emotional damage to individuals, families, and communities\nalike. Despite the severity of this suicide epidemic, there is so far no\nreliable and systematic way to assess suicide intent of a given individual.\nThrough efforts to automate and systematize diagnosis of mental illnesses over\nthe past few years, verbal and acoustic behaviors have received increasing\nattention as biomarkers, but little has been done to study eyelids, gaze, and\nhead pose in evaluating suicide risk. This study explores statistical analysis,\nfeature selection, and machine learning classification as means of suicide risk\nevaluation and nonverbal behavioral interpretation. Applying these methods to\nthe eye and head signals extracted from our unique dataset, this study finds\nthat high-risk suicidal individuals experience psycho-motor retardation and\nsymptoms of anxiety and depression, characterized by eye contact avoidance,\nslower blinks and a downward eye gaze. By comparing results from different\nmethods of classification, we determined that these features are highly capable\nof automatically classifying different levels of suicide risk consistently and\nwith high accuracy, above 98%. Our conclusion corroborates psychological\nstudies, and shows great potential of a systematic approach in suicide risk\nevaluation that is adoptable by both healthcare providers and naive observers.",

Before\nclassification, we employed Principal component analysis (PCA) and\nt-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) to reduce the dimension of\nthe data. In comparison to PCA, the modern data visualization method t-SNE\nperforms better in dimensionality reduction. t-SNE accounts for the possible\nnon-linear patterns in low-dimensional data. We applied four-fold\ncross-validation in which the resulting output from t-SNE was used as training\ndata for the Support Vector Machine (SVM).

    "abstract": "Seasonality is one of the oldest and most elucidation-resistant issues in\nsuicide epidemiological research. Despite winter depression (also known as\nSeasonal Affective Disorder, SAD) is known and treated since many years,\nworldwide cross-sectional data from 28 countries show a lower frequency of\nsuicide attempts around the equinoxes and a higher frequency in spring (both in\nNorthern and Southern Hemisphere). This peak is not compatible with the SAD\nexplanation. However, in recent years epidemiological research has yielded new\nresults, which provide new perspectives on the matter. In fact, the discovery\nof a new pathology called Post-Series Depression (PSD) could provide an\nexplanation of the suicide attempts pattern. The aim of this study is to\nanalyse weekly data in order to compare them with the TV series broadcasting.\nSince medical observations in our sample are distributed over many years, in\norder to compare them as best as we can with the television programming, Grey's\nAnatomy series was chosen. This medical drama has been in the top 10 of most\nviewed TV series since 12 years and it is broadcast all over the world, so that\nit can be considered a universal and homogeneous phenomenon. A full season of\nthe series is split into two separate units with a hiatus around the end of the\ncalendar year, and it runs from September through May. Data analysis was made\nin order to prove the correlation between PSD and the increase of suicide\nattempts. Surprisingly, the data analysis shows that the increase of rate of\nsuicide attempts does not coincide with the breaks in Grey's Anatomy\nscheduling, but with the series broadcasting. This therefore suggests that it\nis the series itself to increase the viewer's depression.",

Design: A data-driven analysis using\ncross-sectional data. Setting: Communities in the state of Montana from 1999 to\n2017. Subjects: Selected 22,447 adolescents of whom 1,631 adolescents attempted\nsuicide at least once. Measures: Overall 29 variables (predictors) accounting\nfor psychological behaviors, illegal substances consumption, daily activities\nat schools and demographic backgrounds, were considered. Analysis: A library of\nmachine learning algorithms along with the traditionally-used logistic\nregression were used to model and predict suicide attempt risk. Model\nperformances (goodness-of-fit and predictive accuracy) were measured using\naccuracy, precision, recall and F-score metrics.

This study\naddresses these gaps and combines theory-driven and bottom-up strategies to\nconstruct a hybrid and interpretable prediction model of valid suicide risk\nfrom images. The lead hypothesis was that images contain valuable information\nabout emotions and interpersonal relationships, two central concepts in\nsuicide-related treatments and theories. The dataset included 177,220 images by\n841 Facebook users who completed a gold-standard suicide scale. The images were\nrepresented with CLIP, a state-of-the-art algorithm, which was utilized,\nunconventionally, to extract predefined features that served as inputs to a\nsimple logistic-regression prediction model (in contrast to complex neural\nnetworks). The features addressed basic and theory-driven visual elements using\neveryday language (e.g., bright photo, photo of sad people). The results of the\nhybrid model (that integrated theory-driven and bottom-up methods) indicated\nhigh prediction performance that surpassed common bottom-up algorithms, thus\nproviding a first proof that images (alone) can be leveraged to predict\nvalidated suicide risk. Corresponding with the lead hypothesis, at-risk users\nhad images with increased negative emotions and decreased belonginess. The\nresults are discussed in the context of non-verbal warning signs of suicide.\nNotably, the study illustrates the advantages of hybrid models in such\ncomplicated tasks and provides simple and flexible prediction strategies that\ncould be utilized to develop real-life monitoring tools of suicide.",

By treating\nthe suicide as a social fact, Durkheim envisaged that suicide rates should be\ndetermined by the connections (or the lack of them) between people and society.\nUnder the same framework, Durkheim considered that crime is bound up with the\nfundamental conditions of all social life and serves a social function. In this\nsense, and regardless of its extremely deviant nature, crime events are somehow\ncapable to release certain social tensions and so have a purging effect in\nsociety. The social effect on the occurrence of homicides has been previously\nsubstantiated (Bettencourt et al., 2007; Alves et al., 2013), and confirmed\nhere, in terms of a superlinear scaling relation: by doubling the population of\na Brazilian city results in an average increment of 135 % in the number of\nhomicides, rather than the expected isometric increase of 100 %, as found, for\nexample, for the mortality due to car crashes. Here we present statistical\nsigns of the social influence on the suicide occurrence in cities.

The objective is to\ndiscriminate between a model based on social ties and a model based on\npsychological traumas. Our methodological strategy is to focus on instances\ncharacterized by the severance of some social ties. We consider several\nsituations of this kind. (i) Prisoners in the first days after their\nincarceration. (ii) Prisoners in solitary confinement. (iii) Prisoners who are\ntransferred from one prison to another. (iv) Prisoners in closed versus open\nprisons. (v) Prisoners in the weeks following their release. (vi) Immigrants in\nthe years following their relocation. (vii) Unmarried versus married people.\n  Furthermore, in order to test the impact of major shocks we consider the\nresponses in terms of suicides to the following shocks. (i) The attack of\nSeptember 11, 2001 in Manhattan. (ii) The Korean War. (iii) The two world wars.\n(iv) The Great Depression in the United States. (v) The hyperinflation episode\nof 1923 in Germany. Major global traumatic shocks such as 9/11 or wars have no\ninfluence on suicide rates once changing environment conditions have been\ncontrolled for.\n  Overall, it turns out that the observations have a natural interpretation in\nterms of short-range ties. In contrast, the trauma model seems unable to\nadequately account for many observations.",

    "abstract": "The monthly pattern of suicides has remained a puzzle ever since it was\ndiscovered in the second half of the 19th century. In this paper we intend to\n\"explain\" not the pattern itself but rather its changes across countries and in\nthe course of time. First, we show that the fairly common idea according to\nwhich this pattern is decaying in \"modern\" societies is not altogether true.\nFor instance, around 2000, in well urbanized countries like South Korea or\nSpain this pattern was still as strong as it was in France (and other European\ncountries) in the late 19th century. The method that we use in order to make\nsome progress in our understanding is the time-honoured Cartesian approach of\nbreaking up the problem under consideration \"into as many parts as might be\nnecessary to solve it\". More specifically, we try two decompositions of monthly\nsuicides: (i) according to suicide methods (ii) according to age-groups.\n  The first decomposition points out the key-role of hanging and drowning. The\nsecond shows the crucial role of the $ 15-20 $ and $ 65+ $ age-groups. Then, we\npresent a number of cases in which age-group decomposition provides adequate\npredictions. It turns out that the cases in which the predictions do not work\nare newly urbanized countries. The discrepancies may be due to a memory effect\nwhich induces a time-lag extending over one or two generations. Finally, in the\nlight of the new results presented in the present paper, we re-examine the\ntheory proposed by Emile Durkheim.",

An open question is how to simulate rare events, not\nnecessarily found in autonomous driving datasets or scripted simulations, but\nwhich can occur in testing, and, in the end may lead to severe pedestrian\nrelated accidents. This paper presents a method for designing a suicidal\npedestrian agent within the CARLA simulator, enabling the automatic generation\nof traffic scenarios for testing safety of autonomous vehicles (AVs) in\ndangerous situations with pedestrians. The pedestrian is modeled as a\nreinforcement learning (RL) agent with two custom reward functions that allow\nthe agent to either arbitrarily or with high velocity to collide with the AV.\nInstead of significantly constraining the initial locations and the pedestrian\nbehavior, we allow the pedestrian and autonomous car to be placed anywhere in\nthe environment and the pedestrian to roam freely to generate diverse\nscenarios. To assess the performance of the suicidal pedestrian and the target\nvehicle during testing, we propose three collision-oriented evaluation metrics.\nExperimental results involving two state-of-the-art autonomous driving\nalgorithms trained end-to-end with imitation learning from sensor data\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of the suicidal pedestrian in identifying\ndecision errors made by autonomous vehicles controlled by the algorithms.",

An extreme form of altruism can be found in colicinogenic E. coli.\nThese suicidal altruists explode, releasing colicins that kill unrelated\nindividuals, which are not colicin resistant. By committing suicide, the\naltruist makes it more likely that its kin will have less competition. The\nbenefits of this strategy rely on the number of competitors and kin nearby. If\nthe organism explodes at an inopportune time, the suicidal act may not harm any\ncompetitors. Communication could enable organisms to act altruistically when\nenvironmental conditions suggest that that strategy would be most beneficial.\nQuorum sensing is a form of communication in which bacteria produce a protein\nand gauge the amount of that protein around them. Quorum sensing is one means\nby which bacteria sense the biotic factors around them and determine when to\nproduce products, such as antibiotics, that influence competition. Suicidal\naltruists could use quorum sensing to determine when exploding is most\nbeneficial, but it is challenging to study the selective forces at work in\nmicrobes. To address these challenges, we use digital evolution (a form of\nexperimental evolution that uses self-replicating computer programs as\norganisms) to investigate the effects of enabling altruistic organisms to\ncommunicate via quorum sensing. We found that quorum-sensing altruists killed a\ngreater number of competitors per explosion, winning competitions against\nnon-communicative altruists.

    "abstract": "On social media, users often express their personal feelings, which may\nexhibit cognitive distortions or even suicidal tendencies on certain specific\ntopics. Early recognition of these signs is critical for effective\npsychological intervention. In this paper, we introduce two novel datasets from\nChinese social media: SOS-HL-1K for suicidal risk classification and\nSocialCD-3K for cognitive distortions detection. The SOS-HL-1K dataset\ncontained 1,249 posts and SocialCD-3K dataset was a multi-label classification\ndataset that containing 3,407 posts. We propose a comprehensive evaluation\nusing two supervised learning methods and eight large language models (LLMs) on\nthe proposed datasets. From the prompt engineering perspective, we experimented\nwith two types of prompt strategies, including four zero-shot and five few-shot\nstrategies. We also evaluated the performance of the LLMs after fine-tuning on\nthe proposed tasks. The experimental results show that there is still a huge\ngap between LLMs relying only on prompt engineering and supervised learning. In\nthe suicide classification task, this gap is 6.95% points in F1-score, while in\nthe cognitive distortion task, the gap is even more pronounced, reaching 31.53%\npoints in F1-score. However, after fine-tuning, this difference is\nsignificantly reduced. In the suicide and cognitive distortion classification\ntasks, the gap decreases to 4.31% and 3.14%, respectively. This research\nhighlights the potential of LLMs in psychological contexts, but supervised\nlearning remains necessary for more challenging tasks. All datasets and code\nare made available.",

    "abstract": "Platforms like Reddit and Twitter offer internet users an opportunity to talk\nabout diverse issues, including those pertaining to physical and mental health.\nSome of these forums also function as a safe space for severely distressed\nmental health patients to get social support from peers. The online community\nplatform Reddit's SuicideWatch is one example of an online forum dedicated\nspecifically to people who suffer from suicidal thoughts, or who are concerned\nabout people who might be at risk. It remains to be seen if these forums can be\nused to understand and model the nature of online social support, not least\nbecause of the noisy and informal nature of conversations. Moreover,\nunderstanding how a community of volunteering peers react to calls for help in\ncases of suicidal posts, would help to devise better tools for online\nmitigation of such episodes. In this paper, we propose an approach to\ncharacterise conversations in online forums. Using data from the SuicideWatch\nsubreddit as a case study, we propose metrics at a macroscopic level --\nmeasuring the structure of the entire conversation as a whole. We also develop\na framework to measure structures in supportive conversations at a mesoscopic\nlevel -- measuring interactions with the immediate neighbours of the person in\ndistress. We statistically show through comparison with baseline conversations\nfrom random Reddit threads that certain macro and meso-scale structures in an\nonline conversation exhibit signatures of social support, and are particularly\nover-expressed in SuicideWatch conversations.",

    "abstract": "Graph and language embedding models are becoming commonplace in large scale\nanalyses given their ability to represent complex sparse data densely in\nlow-dimensional space. Integrating these models' complementary relational and\ncommunicative data may be especially helpful if predicting rare events or\nclassifying members of hidden populations - tasks requiring huge and sparse\ndatasets for generalizable analyses. For example, due to social stigma and\ncomorbidities, mental health support groups often form in amorphous online\ngroups. Predicting suicidality among individuals in these settings using\nstandard network analyses is prohibitive due to resource limits (e.g., memory),\nand adding auxiliary data like text to such models exacerbates complexity- and\nsparsity-related issues. Here, I show how merging graph and language embedding\nmodels (metapath2vec and doc2vec) avoids these limits and extracts unsupervised\nclustering data without domain expertise or feature engineering. Graph and\nlanguage distances to a suicide support group have little correlation (\\r{ho} <\n0.23), implying the two models are not embedding redundant information. When\nused separately to predict suicidality among individuals, graph and language\ndata generate relatively accurate results (69% and 76%, respectively); however,\nwhen integrated, both data produce highly accurate predictions (90%, with 10%\nfalse-positives and 12% false-negatives). Visualizing graph embeddings\nannotated with predictions of potentially suicidal individuals shows the\nintegrated model could classify such individuals even if they are positioned\nfar from the support group. These results extend research on the importance of\nsimultaneously analyzing behavior and language in massive networks and efforts\nto integrate embedding models for different kinds of data when predicting and\nclassifying, particularly when they involve rare events.",

The challenges are building a\ntransparent predictive model that works with a large number of weakly\npredictive features, and at the same time, is stable against resampling\nvariations.

Recently, it was shown by the present authors that\ndisability data from census records can be used as a reliable substitute for\nmortality data. This opens a new route to investigations of family ties because\ncensus information goes much beyond the limited data reported on death\ncertificates. It is shown that the disability rate of adults decreases when\nthey have more family links. More precisely, the reduction of the parents'\ndisability brought about by the presence of a child reveals that the strength\nof ties between parents and child is highest in the first year after birth and\nthen weakens steadily as the child ages.

Motivated by an application of the estimators which allow\ncovariate information to meta-analytic data focused on the prevalence rate of\ncompleted suicide after bariatric surgery, where studies with no completed\nsuicides did not occur, this paper explores the performance of the estimators\nthrough use of a simulation study. The simulation study addresses the\nperformance of the Horvitz-Thompson, generalised Chao and generalised Zelterman\nestimators, in addition to performance of the analytical approach to variance\ncomputation. Given that the estimators vary in their dependence on\ndistributional assumptions, additional simulations are utilised to address the\nquestion of the impact outliers have on performance and inference.",

Although researchers have\nlooked at the implications of rounding continuous random variables, rounding\nmay be applied to functions of discrete random variables as well. For example,\nto infer on suicide excess deaths after a national emergency, authorities may\nprovide a rounded average of deaths before and after the emergency started.\nSuicide rates tend to be relatively low around the world and such rounding may\nseriously affect inference on the change of suicide rate. In this paper, we\nstudy the scenario when a rounded to nearest integer average is used as a proxy\nfor a non-negative discrete random variable. Specifically, our interest is in\ndrawing inference on a parameter from the pmf of Y , when we get U = n[Y /n] as\na proxy for Y . The probability generating function of U , E(U ), and Var(U )\ncapture the effect of the coarsening of the support of Y . Also, moments and\nestimators of distribution parameters are explored for some special cases. We\nshow that under certain conditions, there is little impact from rounding.\nHowever, we also find scenarios where rounding can significantly affect\nstatistical inference as demonstrated in three examples. The simple methods we\npropose are able to partially counter rounding error effects.

The\naccretion rate is therefore much higher than in an ordinary cataclysmic binary\nat the same orbital period, as is the luminosity of the white dwarf primary. In\nthe steady state, the enhanced luminosity is just sufficient to maintain the\nwind from the secondary. The accretion rate and luminosity predicted by the\nwind-driven model for T Pyx are in good agreement with the observational\nevidence. X-ray observations with Chandra or XMM may be able to confirm T Pyx's\nstatus as a SSS.\n  T Pyx's lifetime in the wind-driven state is on the order of a million years.\nIts ultimate fate is not certain, but the system may very well end up\ndestroying itself, either via the complete evaporation of the secondary star,\nor in a Type Ia supernova if the white dwarf reaches the Chandrasekhar limit.\nThus either the primary, the secondary, or both may currently be committing\nassisted stellar suicide.",

    "abstract": "One distinctive and pervasive aspect of social systems is the fact that they\ncomprise several kinds of agents. Thus, in order to draw parallels with\nphysical systems one is lead to consider binary (or multi-component) compounds.\nRecent views about the mixing of liquids in solutions gained from neutron and\nX-ray scattering show these systems to have a number of similarities with\nsocio-economic systems. It appears that such phenomena as rearrangement of\nbonds in a solution, gas condensation, selective evaporation of molecules can\nbe transposed in a natural way to socio-economic phenomena. These connections\nprovide a novel perspective for looking at social systems which we illustrate\nthrough some examples. For instance, we interpret suicide as an escape\nphenomenon and in order to test that interpretation we consider social systems\ncharacterized by very low levels of social interaction. For those systems\nsuicide rates are found to be 10 to 100 times higher than in the general\npopulation. Another interesting parallel concerns the phase transition which\noccurs when locusts gather together to form swarms which may contain several\nbillion insects. What hinders the thorough investigation of such cases from the\nstandpoint of collective phenomena that we advocate is the lack or inadequacy\nof statistical data for, up to now, they were collected for completely\ndifferent purposes. Most essential for further progress are statistics which\nwould permit to estimate the strength of social ties and interactions. Once\nadequate data become available, rapid advance may be expected.",

    "abstract": "Biologists have found that the death rate of cells in culture depends upon\ntheir spatial density. Permanent \"Stay alive\" signals from their neighbours\nseem to prevent them from dying. In a previous paper (Wang et al. 2013) we gave\nevidence for a density effect for ants. In this paper we examine whether there\nis a similar effect in human demography. We find that although there is no\nobservable relationship between population density and overall death rates,\nthere is a clear relationship between density and the death rates of young\nage-groups. Basically their death rates decrease with increasing density.\nHowever, this relationship breaks down around 300 inhabitants per square\nkilometre. Above this threshold the death rates remains fairly constant. The\nsame density effect is observed in Canada, France, Japan and the United States.\nWe also observe a striking parallel between the density effect and the\nso-called marital status effect in the sense that they both lead to higher\nsuicide rates and are both enhanced for younger age-groups. However, it should\nbe noted that the strength of the density effect is only a fraction of the\nstrength of the marital status effect. In spite of the fact that this parallel\ndoes not give us an explanation by itself, it invites us to focus on\nexplanations that apply to both effects. In this light the \"Stay alive\"\nparadigm set forth by Prof. Martin Raff appears as a natural interpretation. It\ncan be seen as an extension of the \"social ties\" framework proposed at the end\nof the 19th century by the sociologist Emile Durkheim in his study about\nsuicide.",

Since the Italian language distinguishes between the female and\nmale cases, we find the presence of gender bias in all Italian newspapers, with\nreported single female deaths to be about one-third of those involving single\nmen. We show evidence of censorship in Italian newspapers both during World War\n1 and during the Italian Fascist regime. Censorship in all countries during\nWorld Wars and in Italy during the Fascist period is a historically ascertained\nfact, but so far there was no estimate on the amount on censorship in newspaper\nreporting: in this work we estimate that about $75\\%$ of domestic deaths and\nsuicides were not reported.

The\noverarching aim of this project is to develop a proof-of-concept model to\ndemonstrate the potential of applying deep learning to crisis text messages.\n  Specifically, this project aims to use deep learning to (1) predict an\nindividual's risk of suicide or self-harm, (2) assess conversation success and\nCV skill using robust metrics, and (3) extrapolate demographic information from\na texter survey to conversations where the texter did not complete the survey.\nTo these ends, contributions to deep learning include a modified\nTransformer-over-BERT model; a framework for multitask learning to improve\ngeneralisation in the presence of sparse labels; and a mathematical model for\nusing imperfect machine learning models to estimate population parameters from\na biased training set.\n  Key results include a deep learning model with likely better performance at\npredicting suicide risk than trained CVs and the ability to predict whether a\ntexter is 21 or under with 88.4% accuracy. We produce three metrics for\nconversation success and evaluate the validity and usefulness for each.\nFinally, reversal of participation bias provides evidence that women, who make\nup 80.3% of conversations with an associated texter survey, make up closer to\n73.5%- 74.8% of all conversations; and that if, after every conversation, the\ntexter had shared whether they found their conversation helpful, affirmative\nanswers would fall from 85.1% to 45.45% - 46.51%.",

However, its\nfeasibility is often hindered by ethical, economical, and legal considerations,\nmaking observational data a valuable alternative for drawing causal\nconclusions. Nevertheless, healthcare observational data presents a difficult\nchallenge due to its high dimensionality, requiring careful consideration to\nensure unbiased, reliable, and robust causal inferences. To overcome this\nchallenge, in this study, we propose a novel two-stage feature selection\ntechnique called, Outcome Adaptive Elastic Net (OAENet), explicitly designed\nfor making robust causal inference decisions using matching techniques. OAENet\noffers several key advantages over existing methods: superior performance on\ncorrelated and high-dimensional data compared to the existing methods and the\nability to select specific sets of variables (including confounders and\nvariables associated only with the outcome). This ensures robustness and\nfacilitates an unbiased estimate of the causal effect. Numerical experiments on\nsimulated data demonstrate that OAENet significantly outperforms\nstate-of-the-art methods by either producing a higher-quality estimate or a\ncomparable estimate in significantly less time. To illustrate the applicability\nof OAENet, we employ large-scale US healthcare data to estimate the effect of\nOpioid Use Disorder (OUD) on suicidal behavior. When compared to competing\nmethods, OAENet closely aligns with existing literature on the relationship\nbetween OUD and suicidal behavior. Performance on both simulated and real-world\ndata highlights that OAENet notably enhances the accuracy of estimating\ntreatment effects or evaluating policy decision-making with causal inference.",

    "abstract": "Previous efforts to support creative problem-solving have included (a)\ntechniques (such as brainstorming and design thinking) to stimulate creative\nideas, and (b) software tools to record and share these ideas. Now, generative\nAI technologies can suggest new ideas that might never have occurred to the\nusers, and users can then select from these ideas or use them to stimulate even\nmore ideas. Here, we describe such a system, Supermind Ideator. The system uses\na large language model (GPT 3.5) and adds prompting, fine tuning, and a user\ninterface specifically designed to help people use creative problem-solving\ntechniques. Some of these techniques can be applied to any problem; others are\nspecifically intended to help generate innovative ideas about how to design\ngroups of people and/or computers (\"superminds\"). We also describe our early\nexperiences with using this system and suggest ways it could be extended to\nsupport additional techniques for other specific problem-solving domains.",

This\nsevere sparsity motivates appropriate statistical methodologies that\neffectively reduce the number of free parameters, with penalized log-linear\nmodels and latent structure analysis being popular options. This article\nproposes a fundamentally new class of methods, which we refer to as Mixture of\nLog Linear models (mills). Combining latent class analysis and log-linear\nmodels, mills defines a novel Bayesian methodology to model complex\nmultivariate categorical with flexibility and interpretability.

    "abstract": "This research paper presents a meta-analysis of the multifaceted role of\ntechnology in mental health. The pervasive influence of technology on daily\nlives necessitates a deep understanding of its impact on mental health\nservices. This study synthesizes literature covering Behavioral Intervention\nTechnologies (BITs), digital mental health interventions during COVID-19, young\nmen's attitudes toward mental health technologies, technology-based\ninterventions for university students, and the applicability of mobile health\ntechnologies for individuals with serious mental illnesses. BITs are recognized\nfor their potential to provide evidence-based interventions for mental health\nconditions, especially anxiety disorders. The COVID-19 pandemic acted as a\ncatalyst for the adoption of digital mental health services, underscoring their\ncrucial role in providing accessible and quality care; however, their efficacy\nneeds to be reinforced by workforce training, high-quality evidence, and\ndigital equity. A nuanced understanding of young men's attitudes toward mental\nhealth is imperative for devising effective online services. Technology-based\ninterventions for university students are promising, although variable in\neffectiveness; their deployment must be evidence-based and tailored to\nindividual needs. Mobile health technologies, particularly activity tracking,\nhold promise for individuals with serious mental illnesses. Collectively,\ntechnology has immense potential to revolutionize mental health care. However,\nthe implementation must be evidence-based, ethical, and equitable, with\ncontinued research focusing on experiences across diverse populations, ensuring\naccessibility and efficacy for all.",

    "abstract": "According to the World Health Organization (WHO), one in four people will be\naffected by mental disorders at some point in their lives. However, in many\nparts of the world, patients do not actively seek professional diagnosis\nbecause of stigma attached to mental illness, ignorance of mental health and\nits associated symptoms. In this paper, we propose a model for passively\ndetecting mental disorders using conversations on Reddit. Specifically, we\nfocus on a subset of mental disorders that are characterized by distinct\nemotional patterns (henceforth called emotional disorders): major depressive,\nanxiety, and bipolar disorders. Through passive (i.e., unprompted) detection,\nwe can encourage patients to seek diagnosis and treatment for mental disorders.\nOur proposed model is different from other work in this area in that our model\nis based entirely on the emotional states, and the transition between these\nstates of users on Reddit, whereas prior work is typically based on\ncontent-based representations (e.g., n-grams, language model embeddings, etc).\nWe show that content-based representation is affected by domain and topic bias\nand thus does not generalize, while our model, on the other hand, suppresses\ntopic-specific information and thus generalizes well across different topics\nand times. We conduct experiments on our model's ability to detect different\nemotional disorders and on the generalizability of our model. Our experiments\nshow that while our model performs comparably to content-based models, such as\nBERT, it generalizes much better across time and topic.",

However, the methods traditionally used for estimating and\ncharacterizing the prevalence of mental health conditions are time-consuming\nand expensive. Consequently, best-available estimates concerning the prevalence\nof mental health conditions are often years out of date. Automated approaches\nto supplement these survey methods with broad, aggregated information derived\nfrom social media content provides a potential means for near real-time\nestimates at scale. These may, in turn, provide grist for supporting,\nevaluating and iteratively improving upon public health programs and\ninterventions.\n  We propose a novel model for automated mental health status quantification\nthat incorporates user embeddings. This builds upon recent work exploring\nrepresentation learning methods that induce embeddings by leveraging social\nmedia post histories. Such embeddings capture latent characteristics of\nindividuals (e.g., political leanings) and encode a soft notion of homophily.\nIn this paper, we investigate whether user embeddings learned from twitter post\nhistories encode information that correlates with mental health statuses. To\nthis end, we estimated user embeddings for a set of users known to be affected\nby depression and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and for a set of\ndemographically matched `control' users. We then evaluated these embeddings\nwith respect to: (i) their ability to capture homophilic relations with respect\nto mental health status; and (ii) the performance of downstream mental health\nprediction models based on these features. Our experimental results demonstrate\nthat the user embeddings capture similarities between users with respect to\nmental conditions, and are predictive of mental health.",

I use random variation in\njudge assignment to compare those who were required to seek weekly mental\nhealth counseling to those who were not. The main findings are that being\nassigned to seek mental health treatment decreases the likelihood of three-year\nrecidivism by about 12 percentage points, or 36 percent. This effect persists\nover time, and is similar among various types of individuals on probation. In\naddition, I show that mental health treatment operates distinctly from drug\naddiction interventions in a multiple-treatment framework. I provide evidence\nthat mental health treatment's longer-term effectiveness is strongest among\nmore financially-advantaged probationers, consistent with this setting, in\nwhich the cost of mandated treatment is shouldered by offenders. Finally,\nconservative calculations result in a 5:1 benefit-to-cost ratio which suggests\nthat the treatment-induced decrease in future crime would be more than\nsufficient to offset the costs of treatment.",

It is projected that mental health disorders will be the leading\ncause of morbidity among adults as the incidence rates of anxiety and\ndepression grows globally. Recently, extended reality (XR), a general term\ncovering virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR) and mixed reality (MR),\nis paving a new way to deliver mental health care. In this paper, we conduct a\nscoping review on the development and application of XR in the area of mental\ndisorders. We performed a scoping database search to identify the relevant\nstudies indexed in Google Scholar, PubMed, and the ACM Digital Library. A\nsearch period between August 2016 and December 2023 was defined to select\narticles related to the usage of VR, AR, and MR in a mental health context. We\nidentified a total of 85 studies from 27 countries across the globe. By\nperforming data analysis, we found that most of the studies focused on\ndeveloped countries such as the US (16.47%) and Germany (12.94%). None of the\nstudies were for African countries. The majority of the articles reported that\nXR techniques led to a significant reduction in symptoms of anxiety or\ndepression. More studies were published in the year 2021, i.e., 31.76% (n =\n31). This could indicate that mental disorder intervention received a higher\nattention when COVID-19 emerged. Most studies (n = 65) focused on a population\nbetween 18 and 65 years old, only a few studies focused on teenagers (n = 2).\nAlso, more studies were done experimentally (n = 67, 78.82%) rather than by\nanalytical and modeling approaches (n = 8, 9.41%). This shows that there is a\nrapid development of XR technology for mental health care. Furthermore, these\nstudies showed that XR technology can effectively be used for evaluating mental\ndisorders in similar or better way as the conventional approaches.",

Recently Artificial Intelligence (AI) methods\nhave been presented to help mental health providers, including psychiatrists\nand psychologists, in decision making based on patients' authentic information\n(e.g., medical records, behavioral data, social media utilization, etc.). AI\ninnovations have demonstrated predominant execution in numerous real-world\napplications broadening from computer vision to healthcare. This study analyzes\nunstructured user data on the Reddit platform and classifies five common mental\nillnesses: depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder, ADHD, and PTSD. We trained\ntraditional machine learning, deep learning, and transfer learning multi-class\nmodels to detect mental disorders of individuals. This effort will benefit the\npublic health system by automating the detection process and informing\nappropriate authorities about people who require emergency assistance.",

Symptoms of these mental disorders are usually observed\npassively today, resulting in delayed clinical intervention. In this paper, we\nargue that mining online social behavior provides an opportunity to actively\nidentify SNMDs at an early stage. It is challenging to detect SNMDs because the\nmental factors considered in standard diagnostic criteria (questionnaire)\ncannot be observed from online social activity logs. Our approach, new and\ninnovative to the practice of SNMD detection, does not rely on self-revealing\nof those mental factors via questionnaires. Instead, we propose a machine\nlearning framework, namely, Social Network Mental Disorder Detection (SNMDD),\nthat exploits features extracted from social network data to accurately\nidentify potential cases of SNMDs. We also exploit multi-source learning in\nSNMDD and propose a new SNMD-based Tensor Model (STM) to improve the\nperformance. Our framework is evaluated via a user study with 3126 online\nsocial network users. We conduct a feature analysis, and also apply SNMDD on\nlarge-scale datasets and analyze the characteristics of the three SNMD types.\nThe results show that SNMDD is promising for identifying online social network\nusers with potential SNMDs.",

In the present study we investigate how common a\nneuroreductionist inclination is among highly educated people.

Identically graphed, simulated data of mind-brain correlations were\nshown in three contexts with presumably different presumptions about causality.\n738 highly-educated laymen rated plausibility of causality attribution from\nbrain to mind and from mind to brain for correlations between brain structural\nproperties and mental phenomena. We contrasted participants' plausibility\nratings of causality in the contexts of commonly perceived brain-lesion induced\nbehavior (aphasia), behavior-induced training effects (piano playing), and a\nnewly described mental disorder (BID).\n  Results. The findings reveal the expected context-dependent modulation of\ncausality attributions in the contexts of aphasia and piano playing.\nFurthermore, we observed a significant tendency to more readily attribute\ncausal inference from brain to mind than vice versa with respect to BID.\n  Conclusion. In some contexts, exemplified here by aphasia and piano playing,\nunidirectional causality attributions may be justified.

One's patterns of emotion change have traditionally been\ndetermined through self-reports of emotions; however, there are known issues\nwith accuracy, bias, and ease of data collection. Recent approaches to\ndetermining emotion dynamics from one's everyday utterances addresses many of\nthese concerns, but it is not yet known whether these measures of utterance\nemotion dynamics (UED) correlate with mental health diagnoses. Here, for the\nfirst time, we study the relationship between tweet emotion dynamics and mental\nhealth disorders. We find that each of the UED metrics studied varied by the\nuser's self-disclosed diagnosis. For example: average valence was significantly\nhigher (i.e., more positive text) in the control group compared to users with\nADHD, MDD, and PTSD. Valence variability was significantly lower in the control\ngroup compared to ADHD, depression, bipolar disorder, MDD, PTSD, and OCD but\nnot PPD.

Therefore, there is a need for new strategies for diagnosis of mental\nhealth problems. The recent introduction of body-area networks consisting of a\nplethora of accurate sensors embedded in smartwatches and smartphones and deep\nneural networks (DNNs) points towards a possible solution. However, disease\ndiagnosis based on WMSs and DNNs, and their deployment on edge devices, remains\na challenging problem.

MHDeep uses eight different categories of data obtained from sensors\nintegrated in a smartwatch and smartphone. Due to limited available data,\nMHDeep uses a synthetic data generation module to augment real data with\nsynthetic data drawn from the same probability distribution. We use the\nsynthetic dataset to pre-train the DNN models, thus imposing a prior on the\nweights. We use a grow-and-prune DNN synthesis approach to learn both the\narchitecture and weights during the training process. We use three different\ndata partitions to evaluate the MHDeep models trained with data collected from\n74 individuals.

Along with this, in one of our analyses, we were able\nto localize a region close to the pSTS, where the activation depicted the\nparticipants' 'ability to mentalize'. Based on our observations, we modelled\nthe prediction of mentalization and propose our model as an approach towards\ndeveloping a brain-activity based model to detect ToM (Theory of Mind)\ndifficulties, which could be useful in research about disorders like Autism\nSpectrum Disorder (ASD) as well as assessment of mentalization-based\ntreatments. Additionally, we use our findings to reiterate how the Resting\nState might not always act as a good control condition and that control\nconditions should be task-specific.",

The results showed that connectivity-based\nneurofeedback effectively improved BOLD signal change and connectivity in key\nemotion regulation regions such as the amygdala, thalamus, and insula, and\nincreased EEG frontal asymmetry, which is a biomarker for emotion regulation\nand treatment of mental disorders such as PTSD, anxiety, and depression and\ncoherence among EEG channels. The psychometric evaluations conducted both\nbefore and after the neurofeedback experiments revealed that participants\ndemonstrated improvements in enhancing positive emotions and reducing negative\nemotions when utilizing connectivity-based neurofeedback, as compared to\ntraditional activity-based and sham neurofeedback approaches. These findings\nsuggest that connectivity-based neurofeedback may be a superior method for\nregulating emotions and could be a useful alternative therapy for mental\ndisorders, providing individuals with greater control over their brain and\nmental functions.",

With the advent of machine learning (ML),\nthere's potential to harness computational techniques for better understanding\nand addressing these problems. This review seeks to elucidate the current ML\nmethodologies employed in this domain to enhance the detection, prediction, and\nanalysis of mental stress and MDs.\n  Objective: This review aims to investigate the scope of ML methodologies used\nin the detection, prediction, and analysis of mental stress and MDs.\n  Methods: Utilizing a rigorous scoping review process with PRISMA-ScR\nguidelines, this investigation delves into the latest ML algorithms,\npreprocessing techniques, and data types used in the context of stress and\nstress-related MDs.\n  Results and Discussion: A total of 98 peer-reviewed publications were\nexamined. The findings highlight that Support Vector Machine (SVM), Neural\nNetwork (NN), and Random Forest (RF) models consistently exhibit superior\naccuracy and robustness among ML algorithms. Physiological parameters such as\nheart rate measurements and skin response are prevalently used as stress\npredictors due to their rich explanatory information and ease of data\nacquisition. Dimensionality reduction techniques, including mappings, feature\nselection, filtering, and noise reduction, are frequently observed as crucial\nsteps preceding the training of ML algorithms.\n  Conclusion: This review identifies significant research gaps and outlines\nfuture directions for the field.

The recent proliferation of\nmental health discussions on social media platforms presents research\nopportunities to investigate mental health and potentially detect instances of\nmental illness. However, existing depression detection methods are constrained\ndue to two major limitations: (1) the reliance on feature engineering and (2)\nthe lack of consideration for time-varying factors. Specifically, these methods\nrequire extensive feature engineering and domain knowledge, which heavily rely\non the amount, quality, and type of user-generated content. Moreover, these\nmethods ignore the important impact of time-varying factors on depression\ndetection, such as the dynamics of linguistic patterns and interpersonal\ninteractive behaviors over time on social media (e.g., replies, mentions, and\nquote-tweets). To tackle these limitations, we propose an early depression\ndetection framework, ContrastEgo treats each user as a dynamic time-evolving\nattributed graph (ego-network) and leverages supervised contrastive learning to\nmaximize the agreement of users' representations at different scales while\nminimizing the agreement of users' representations to differentiate between\ndepressed and control groups.

We present an approach for forecasting mental health conditions and\nemotions of a given population during the COVID-19 pandemic in Argentina based\non language expressions used in social media. This approach permits\nanticipating high prevalence periods in short- to medium-term time horizons.\nDesign. Mental health conditions and emotions are captured via markers, which\nlink social media contents with lexicons. First, we build descriptive timelines\nfor decision makers to monitor the evolution of markers, and their correlation\nwith crisis events. Second, we model the timelines as time series, and support\ntheir forecasting, which in turn serve to identify high prevalence points for\nthe estimated markers. Findings. Results showed that different time series\nforecasting strategies offer different capabilities. In the best scenario, the\nemergence of high prevalence periods of emotions and mental health disorders\ncan be satisfactorily predicted with a neural network strategy, even when\nlimited data is available in early stages of a crisis (e.g., 7 days).\nOriginality. Although there have been efforts in the literature to predict\nmental states of individuals, the analysis of mental health at the collective\nlevel has received scarce attention.

We introduced a\ntailored method for constructing graph structures specifically designed for\nanalyzing EEG data, alongside the development of a vertex-level GNN\nclassification model for precise detection of mental disorders. In order to\nverify the method's performance, we conduct experiments on two disease datasets\nusing a subject-independent experiment scenario. For the Schizophrenia (SZ)\ndata, our method achieves an average accuracy of 100% using only the first 300\nseconds of data from each subject. Similarly, for Major Depressive Disorder\n(MDD) data, the method yields average accuracies of over 99%. These experiments\ndemonstrate the method's ability to effectively distinguish between healthy\ncontrol (HC) subjects and patients with mental disorders. We believe this\nmethod shows great promise for clinical diagnosis.",

    "abstract": "This literature review involves the use of AI communication facilitators to\ndetect mood disorders such as bipolar disorder, a psychiatric condition in\nwhich patients experience drastic mood shifts. Due to the ill-defined nature of\nthe disorder, it is difficult for even a psychiatrist alone to be confident\nwith their diagnosis. Changes in mental and mood state are often highly\nsubjective and difficult to pinpoint through short-term surveys and psychiatric\nconsultations. For many patients, diagnosis and treatment based on\ntrial-and-error is unavoidable. A timely and thorough diagnosis and treatment\nplan is associated with the need for an equal involvement of both the patient\nand the psychiatrist throughout the process. This conclusion is reached through\na detailed assessment of current interventions for (i) the ill-defined nature\nof the disorder, and (ii) the trial-and-error requirement for medication and\ndiagnosis. As a result, I propose the implementation of an AI communication\nfacilitator that can aid in the appropriate diagnosis and treatment of bipolar\ndisorder by embodying the shared decision-making model. I propose that the\nmodel can be broken down into specific critical decision points with\nconsiderations made for each party involved in the process, aligning with the\nservice blueprint model. I conclude by emphasizing the importance of AI in\nbipolar disorder diagnosis and treatment due to its ability to embrace patient\nheterogeneity, and bridge the gap between mental healthcare and human-AI\ninteraction.",

Our findings reveal significant\ndifferences on the use of function words, such as adverbs and verb tense, and\ntopic-specific vocabulary, such as biological processes. As for emotional\nexpression, we observe that affected users tend to share emotions more\nregularly than control individuals on average.

In order to move the field towards more\nquantitative fashion, we need advanced and scalable machine learning\ninfrastructure that will allow us to identify reliable biomarkers of mental\nhealth disorders. In this paper, we propose a framework called ASD-DiagNet for\nclassifying subjects with ASD from healthy subjects by using only fMRI data. We\ndesigned and implemented a joint learning procedure using an autoencoder and a\nsingle layer perceptron which results in improved quality of extracted features\nand optimized parameters for the model. Further, we designed and implemented a\ndata augmentation strategy, based on linear interpolation on available feature\nvectors, that allows us to produce synthetic datasets needed for training of\nmachine learning models. The proposed approach is evaluated on a public dataset\nprovided by Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange including 1035 subjects coming\nfrom 17 different brain imaging centers. Our machine learning model outperforms\nother state of the art methods from 13 imaging centers with increase in\nclassification accuracy up to 20% with maximum accuracy of 80%.

Overall, our\nrule-based model achieves the best performance, with outputs that are close to\nground truth reference and contain the highest levels of empathy. Human users\nprefer the rule-based chatbot over the generative chatbot for its\ncontext-specific and human-like replies. Our generative chatbot also produced\nempathetic responses and was described by human users as engaging. However,\nlimitations in the training dataset often result in confusing or nonsensical\nresponses. We conclude by discussing practical benefits of rule-based vs.\ngenerative models for supporting individuals with mental health challenges.

    "abstract": "In the current age, human lifestyle has become more knowledge oriented\nleading to generation of sedentary employment. This has given rise to a number\nof health and mental disorders. Mental wellness is one of the most neglected\nbut crucial aspects of today's world. Mental health issues can, both directly\nand indirectly, affect other sections of human physiology and impede an\nindividual's day-to-day activities and performance. However, identifying the\nstress and finding the stress trend for an individual leading to serious mental\nailments is challenging and involves multiple factors. Such identification can\nbe achieved accurately by fusing these multiple modalities (due to various\nfactors) arising from behavioral patterns. Certain techniques are identified in\nthe literature for this purpose; however, very few machine learning-based\nmethods are proposed for such multimodal fusion tasks. In this work, a\nmultimodal AI-based framework is proposed to monitor a person's working\nbehavior and stress levels. We propose a methodology for efficiently detecting\nstress due to workload by concatenating heterogeneous raw sensor data streams\n(e.g., face expressions, posture, heart rate, computer interaction). This data\ncan be securely stored and analyzed to understand and discover personalized\nunique behavioral patterns leading to mental strain and fatigue. The\ncontribution of this work is twofold; proposing a multimodal AI-based strategy\nfor fusion to detect stress and its level and secondly identify a stress\npattern over a period of time. We were able to achieve 96.09% accuracy on the\ntest set in stress detection and classification. Further, we reduce the stress\nscale prediction model loss to 0.036 using these modalities. This work can\nprove important for the community at large, specifically those working\nsedentary jobs to monitor and identify stress levels, especially in current\ntimes of COVID-19.",

    "abstract": "Mental disorders (MD) are among the top most demanding challenges in\nworld-wide health. According to the World Health Organization, the burden of\nMDs continues to grow with significant impact on health and major social and\nhuman rights. A large number of MDs exhibit pathological rhythms, which serve\nas the disorders characteristic biomarkers. These rhythms are the targets for\nneurostimulation techniques. Open-loop neurostimulation employs stimulation\nprotocols, which are rather independent of the patients health and brain state\nin the moment of treatment. Most alternative closed-loop stimulation protocols\nconsider real-time brain activity observations but appear as adaptive open-loop\nprotocols, where e.g. pre-defined stimulation sets in if observations fulfil\npre-defined criteria. The present theoretical work proposes a fully-adaptive\nclosed-loop neurostimulation setup, that tunes the brain activities power\nspectral density (PSD) according to a user-defined PSD. The utilized brain\nmodel is non-parametric and estimated from the observations via magnitude\nfitting in a pre-stimulus setup phase. Moreover, the algorithm takes into\naccount possible conduction delays in the feedback connection between\nobservation and stimulation electrode. All involved features are illustrated on\npathological alpha- and gamma-rhythms known from psychosis. To this end, we\nsimulate numerically a linear neural population brain model and a non-linear\ncortico-thalamic feedback loop model recently derived to explain brain activity\nin psychosis.",

    "abstract": "Major depressive disorder is a serious and heterogeneous psychiatric disorder\nthat needs accurate diagnosis. Resting-state functional MRI (rsfMRI), which\ncaptures multiple perspectives on brain structure, function, and connectivity,\nis increasingly applied in the diagnosis and pathological research of mental\ndiseases. Different machine learning algorithms are then developed to exploit\nthe rich information in rsfMRI and discriminate MDD patients from normal\ncontrols. Despite recent advances reported, the discrimination accuracy has\nroom for further improvement. The generalizability and interpretability of the\nmethod are not sufficiently addressed either. Here, we propose a machine\nlearning method (MFMC) for MDD discrimination by concatenating multiple\nfeatures and stacking multiple classifiers. MFMC is tested on the REST-meta-MDD\ndata set that contains 2428 subjects collected from 25 different sites. MFMC\nyields 96.9% MDD discrimination accuracy, demonstrating a significant\nimprovement over existing methods. In addition, the generalizability of MFMC is\nvalidated by the good performance when the training and testing subjects are\nfrom independent sites. The use of XGBoost as the meta classifier allows us to\nprobe the decision process of MFMC. We identify 13 feature values related to 9\nbrain regions including the posterior cingulate gyrus, superior frontal gyrus\norbital part, and angular gyrus, which contribute most to the classification\nand also demonstrate significant differences at the group level. The use of\nthese 13 feature values alone can reach 87% of MFMC's full performance when\ntaking all feature values. These features may serve as clinically useful\ndiagnostic and prognostic biomarkers for mental disorders in the future.",

    "abstract": "Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) presents itself as a highly debilitating\ndisorder. The disorder has common associations with the prefrontal cortex and\nthe glutamate receptor known as Metabotropic Glutamate Receptor 5 (mGluR5).\nThis receptor has been observed to demonstrate higher levels of signaling from\npositron emission tomography scans measured by its distribution volume ratios\nin mice. Despite this evidence, studies are unable to fully verify the\ninvolvement of mGluR5 as more empirical data is needed. Computational modeling\nmethods were used as a means of validation for previous hypotheses involving\nmGluR5. The inadequacies in relation to the causal factor of OCD were answered\nby utilizing T1 resting-state magnetic resonance imaging (TRS-MRI) scans of\npatients suffering from schizophrenia, major depressive disorder, and\nobsessive-compulsive disorder. Because comorbid cases often occur within these\ndisorders, cross-comparative abilities become necessary to find distinctive\ncharacteristics. Two-dimensional convolutional neural networks alongside\nResNet50 and MobileNet models were constructed and evaluated for efficiency.\nActivation heatmaps of TRS-MRI scans were outputted, allowing for\ntranscriptomics analysis. Though, a lack of ability to predict OCD cases\nprevented gene expression analysis. Across all models, there was an 88.75%\nvalidation accuracy for MDD, and 82.08% validation accuracy for SZD under the\nframework of ResNet50 as well as novel computation. OCD yielded an accuracy\nrate of around 54.4%. These results provided further evidence for the p-factor\ntheory regarding mental disorders.

    "abstract": "Recently we developed a new framework in Hirz et al (2015) to model\nstochastic mortality using extended CreditRisk$^+$ methodology which is very\ndifferent from traditional time series methods used for mortality modelling\npreviously. In this framework, deaths are driven by common latent stochastic\nrisk factors which may be interpreted as death causes like neoplasms,\ncirculatory diseases or idiosyncratic components. These common factors\nintroduce dependence between policyholders in annuity portfolios or between\ndeath events in population. This framework can be used to construct life tables\nbased on mortality rate forecast. Moreover this framework allows stress testing\nand, therefore, offers insight into how certain health scenarios influence\nannuity payments of an insurer. Such scenarios may include improvement in\nhealth treatments or better medication. In this paper, using publicly available\ndata for Australia, we estimate the model using Markov chain Monte Carlo method\nto identify leading death causes across all age groups including long term\nforecast for 2031 and 2051. On top of general reduced mortality, the proportion\nof deaths for certain certain causes has changed massively over the period 1987\nto 2011. Our model forecasts suggest that if these trends persist, then the\nfuture gives a whole new picture of mortality for people aged above 40 years.\nNeoplasms will become the overall number-one death cause. Moreover, deaths due\nto mental and behavioural disorders are very likely to surge whilst deaths due\nto circulatory diseases will tend to decrease. This potential increase in\ndeaths due to mental and behavioural disorders for older ages will have a\nmassive impact on social systems as, typically, such patients need long-term\ngeriatric care.",

    "abstract": "Schizophrenia (SZ) is a prevalent mental disorder characterized by cognitive,\nemotional, and behavioral changes. Symptoms of SZ include hallucinations,\nillusions, delusions, lack of motivation, and difficulties in concentration.\nDiagnosing SZ involves employing various tools, including clinical interviews,\nphysical examinations, psychological evaluations, the Diagnostic and\nStatistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM), and neuroimaging techniques.\nElectroencephalography (EEG) recording is a significant functional neuroimaging\nmodality that provides valuable insights into brain function during SZ.\nHowever, EEG signal analysis poses challenges for neurologists and scientists\ndue to the presence of artifacts, long-term recordings, and the utilization of\nmultiple channels. To address these challenges, researchers have introduced\nartificial intelligence (AI) techniques, encompassing conventional machine\nlearning (ML) and deep learning (DL) methods, to aid in SZ diagnosis. This\nstudy reviews papers focused on SZ diagnosis utilizing EEG signals and AI\nmethods. The introduction section provides a comprehensive explanation of SZ\ndiagnosis methods and intervention techniques. Subsequently, review papers in\nthis field are discussed, followed by an introduction to the AI methods\nemployed for SZ diagnosis and a summary of relevant papers presented in tabular\nform. Additionally, this study reports on the most significant challenges\nencountered in SZ diagnosis, as identified through a review of papers in this\nfield. Future directions to overcome these challenges are also addressed. The\ndiscussion section examines the specific details of each paper, culminating in\nthe presentation of conclusions and findings.",

If and how network\ncontrollability is related to mental health remains elusive.\n  Methods: From Diffusion Tensor Imaging data, we inferred structural\nconnectivity and inferred calculated network controllability parameters to\ninvestigate their association with genetic and familial risk in patients\ndiagnosed with major depressive disorder (MDD, n=692) and healthy controls\n(n=820).\n  Results: First, we establish that controllability measures differ between\nhealthy controls and MDD patients while not varying with current symptom\nseverity or remission status.

Finally, we provide evidence that controllability varies\nwith familial risk of MDD and bipolar disorder as well as with body mass index.\n  Conclusions: We show that network controllability is related to genetic,\nindividual, and familial risk in MDD patients.

Modern multivariate statistical\nmethods developed in the rapidly growing field of machine learning are being\nincreasingly applied to various problems in neuroimaging, from cognitive state\ndetection to clinical diagnosis and prognosis. Multivariate pattern analysis\nmethods are designed to examine complex relationships between high-dimensional\nsignals, such as brain images, and outcomes of interest, such as the category\nof a stimulus, a type of a mental state of a subject, or a specific mental\ndisorder. Such techniques are in contrast with the traditional mass-univariate\napproaches that dominated neuroimaging in the past and treated each individual\nimaging measurement in isolation.\n  We believe that machine learning has a prominent role in shaping how\nquestions in neuroscience are framed, and that the machine-learning mind set is\nnow entering modern psychology and behavioral studies. It is also equally\nimportant that practical applications in these fields motivate a rapidly\nevolving line or research in the machine learning community.

    "abstract": "We developed computational models to predict the emergence of depression and\nPost-Traumatic Stress Disorder in Twitter users. Twitter data and details of\ndepression history were collected from 204 individuals (105 depressed, 99\nhealthy). We extracted predictive features measuring affect, linguistic style,\nand context from participant tweets (N=279,951) and built models using these\nfeatures with supervised learning algorithms. Resulting models successfully\ndiscriminated between depressed and healthy content, and compared favorably to\ngeneral practitioners' average success rates in diagnosing depression. Results\nheld even when the analysis was restricted to content posted before first\ndepression diagnosis. State-space temporal analysis suggests that onset of\ndepression may be detectable from Twitter data several months prior to\ndiagnosis. Predictive results were replicated with a separate sample of\nindividuals diagnosed with PTSD (174 users, 243,775 tweets). A state-space time\nseries model revealed indicators of PTSD almost immediately post-trauma, often\nmany months prior to clinical diagnosis. These methods suggest a data-driven,\npredictive approach for early screening and detection of mental illness.",

    "abstract": "Depression is one of the most common mental health disorders, and a large\nnumber of depressed people commit suicide each year. Potential depression\nsufferers usually do not consult psychological doctors because they feel\nashamed or are unaware of any depression, which may result in severe delay of\ndiagnosis and treatment. In the meantime, evidence shows that social media data\nprovides valuable clues about physical and mental health conditions. In this\npaper, we argue that it is feasible to identify depression at an early stage by\nmining online social behaviours. Our approach, which is innovative to the\npractice of depression detection, does not rely on the extraction of numerous\nor complicated features to achieve accurate depression detection. Instead, we\npropose a novel classifier, namely, Cost-sensitive Boosting Pruning Trees\n(CBPT), which demonstrates a strong classification ability on two publicly\naccessible Twitter depression detection datasets. To comprehensively evaluate\nthe classification capability of the CBPT, we use additional three datasets\nfrom the UCI machine learning repository and the CBPT obtains appealing\nclassification results against several state of the arts boosting algorithms.\nFinally, we comprehensively explore the influence factors of model prediction,\nand the results manifest that our proposed framework is promising for\nidentifying Twitter users with depression.",

Catchy headlines and emotionally charged articles increase the\nnumber of readers which in turn increases ad revenue for websites.

The ability to accurately and efficiently\npredict mood from easily collectible data has several important implications\nfor the early detection, intervention, and treatment of mental health\ndisorders. One promising data source to help monitor human behavior is daily\nsmartphone usage. However, care must be taken to summarize behaviors without\nidentifying the user through personal (e.g., personally identifiable\ninformation) or protected (e.g., race, gender) attributes. In this paper, we\nstudy behavioral markers of daily mood using a recent dataset of mobile\nbehaviors from adolescent populations at high risk of suicidal behaviors. Using\ncomputational models, we find that language and multimodal representations of\nmobile typed text (spanning typed characters, words, keystroke timings, and app\nusage) are predictive of daily mood. However, we find that models trained to\npredict mood often also capture private user identities in their intermediate\nrepresentations. To tackle this problem, we evaluate approaches that obfuscate\nuser identity while remaining predictive. By combining multimodal\nrepresentations with privacy-preserving learning, we are able to push forward\nthe performance-privacy frontier.",

Our goal is to\ndevelop a novel Bayesian Support Vector Machine (SVM) approach that\nincorporates high-dimensional networks as covariates and is able to overcome\nlimitations of existing penalized methods. Methods: We develop a novel\nDirichlet process mixture of double exponential priors on the coefficients in\nthe Bayesian SVM model that is able to perform feature selection and\nuncertainty quantification, by pooling information across edges to determine\ndifferential sparsity levels in an unsupervised manner. We develop different\nversions of the model that incorporates static and dynamic connectivity\nfeatures, as well as an integrative analysis that jointly includes features\nfrom multiple scanning sessions. We perform classification of intelligence\nlevels using resting state fMRI data from the Human Connectome Project (HCP),\nand a second Attention Deficiency Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) classification\ntask. Results: Our results clearly reveal the considerable greater\nclassification accuracy under the proposed approach over state-of-the-art\nmethods.

    "abstract": "Hallucination is an apparent perception in the absence of real external\nsensory stimuli. An auditory hallucination is a perception of hearing sounds\nthat are not real. A common form of auditory hallucination is hearing voices in\nthe absence of any speakers which is known as Auditory Verbal Hallucination\n(AVH). AVH is fragments of the mind's creation that mostly occur in people\ndiagnosed with mental illnesses such as bipolar disorder and schizophrenia.\nAssessing the valence of hallucinated voices (i.e., how negative or positive\nvoices are) can help measure the severity of a mental illness. We study N=435\nindividuals, who experience hearing voices, to assess auditory verbal\nhallucination. Participants report the valence of voices they hear four times a\nday for a month through ecological momentary assessments with questions that\nhave four answering scales from ``not at all'' to ``extremely''. We collect\nthese self-reports as the valence supervision of AVH events via a mobile\napplication. Using the application, participants also record audio diaries to\ndescribe the content of hallucinated voices verbally. In addition, we passively\ncollect mobile sensing data as contextual signals. We then experiment with how\npredictive these linguistic and contextual cues from the audio diary and mobile\nsensing data are of an auditory verbal hallucination event. Finally, using\ntransfer learning and data fusion techniques, we train a neural net model that\npredicts the valance of AVH with a performance of 54\\% top-1 and 72\\% top-2 F1\nscore.",

While literature\nhas shown the existence of an association between posting hate speech and\nmisinformation online and certain personality traits of posters, the general\nrelationship and relevance of online hate speech/misinformation in the context\nof overall psychological wellbeing of posters remain elusive.

The COVID-19 pandemic acted as a\ncatalyst for the adoption of digital mental health services, underscoring their\ncrucial role in providing accessible and quality care; however, their efficacy\nneeds to be reinforced by workforce training, high-quality evidence, and\ndigital equity. A nuanced understanding of young men's attitudes toward mental\nhealth is imperative for devising effective online services. Technology-based\ninterventions for university students are promising, although variable in\neffectiveness; their deployment must be evidence-based and tailored to\nindividual needs. Mobile health technologies, particularly activity tracking,\nhold promise for individuals with serious mental illnesses. Collectively,\ntechnology has immense potential to revolutionize mental health care. However,\nthe implementation must be evidence-based, ethical, and equitable, with\ncontinued research focusing on experiences across diverse populations, ensuring\naccessibility and efficacy for all.",

However, the methods traditionally used for estimating and\ncharacterizing the prevalence of mental health conditions are time-consuming\nand expensive. Consequently, best-available estimates concerning the prevalence\nof mental health conditions are often years out of date. Automated approaches\nto supplement these survey methods with broad, aggregated information derived\nfrom social media content provides a potential means for near real-time\nestimates at scale. These may, in turn, provide grist for supporting,\nevaluating and iteratively improving upon public health programs and\ninterventions.\n  We propose a novel model for automated mental health status quantification\nthat incorporates user embeddings. This builds upon recent work exploring\nrepresentation learning methods that induce embeddings by leveraging social\nmedia post histories. Such embeddings capture latent characteristics of\nindividuals (e.g., political leanings) and encode a soft notion of homophily.\nIn this paper, we investigate whether user embeddings learned from twitter post\nhistories encode information that correlates with mental health statuses. To\nthis end, we estimated user embeddings for a set of users known to be affected\nby depression and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and for a set of\ndemographically matched `control' users. We then evaluated these embeddings\nwith respect to: (i) their ability to capture homophilic relations with respect\nto mental health status; and (ii) the performance of downstream mental health\nprediction models based on these features. Our experimental results demonstrate\nthat the user embeddings capture similarities between users with respect to\nmental conditions, and are predictive of mental health.",

However, there is still\na lack of standard in evaluating bias in such machine learning models in the\nfield, which leads to challenges in providing reliable predictions and in\naddressing disparities. This lack of standards persists due to factors such as\ntechnical difficulties, complexities of high dimensional clinical health data,\netc., which are especially true for physiological signals.

Though there are many existing systems that\ndetects mental illness of a person by analysing their social media data,\ndetecting the level of depression is also important for further treatment.\nThus, in this research, we developed a gold standard data set that detects the\nlevels of depression as `not depressed', `moderately depressed' and `severely\ndepressed' from the social media postings. Traditional learning algorithms were\nemployed on this data set and an empirical analysis was presented in this\npaper. Data augmentation technique was applied to overcome the data imbalance.\nAmong the several variations that are implemented, the model with Word2Vec\nvectorizer and Random Forest classifier on augmented data outperforms the other\nvariations with a score of 0.877 for both accuracy and F1 measure.",

Online peer-to-peer support platforms attempt\nto alleviate this fundamental gap by enabling those who struggle with mental\nillness to provide and receive social support from their peers. However,\nsuccessful social support requires users to engage with each other and failures\nmay have serious consequences for users in need. Our understanding of\nengagement patterns on mental health platforms is limited but critical to\ninform the role, limitations, and design of these platforms. Here, we present a\nlarge-scale analysis of engagement patterns of 35 million posts on two popular\nonline mental health platforms, TalkLife and Reddit. Leveraging communication\nmodels in human-computer interaction and communication theory, we\noperationalize a set of four engagement indicators based on attention and\ninteraction. We then propose a generative model to jointly model these\nindicators of engagement, the output of which is synthesized into a novel set\nof eleven distinct, interpretable patterns. We demonstrate that this framework\nof engagement patterns enables informative evaluations and analysis of online\nsupport platforms. Specifically, we find that mutual back-and-forth\ninteractions are associated with significantly higher user retention rates on\nTalkLife. Such back-and-forth interactions, in turn, are associated with early\nresponse times and the sentiment of posts.",

In this paper, we propose a model for passively\ndetecting mental disorders using conversations on Reddit.

Through passive (i.e., unprompted) detection,\nwe can encourage patients to seek diagnosis and treatment for mental disorders.\nOur proposed model is different from other work in this area in that our model\nis based entirely on the emotional states, and the transition between these\nstates of users on Reddit, whereas prior work is typically based on\ncontent-based representations (e.g., n-grams, language model embeddings, etc).\nWe show that content-based representation is affected by domain and topic bias\nand thus does not generalize, while our model, on the other hand, suppresses\ntopic-specific information and thus generalizes well across different topics\nand times. We conduct experiments on our model's ability to detect different\nemotional disorders and on the generalizability of our model.

Recent approaches to\ndetermining emotion dynamics from one's everyday utterances addresses many of\nthese concerns, but it is not yet known whether these measures of utterance\nemotion dynamics (UED) correlate with mental health diagnoses.

Valence variability was significantly lower in the control\ngroup compared to ADHD, depression, bipolar disorder, MDD, PTSD, and OCD but\nnot PPD.

The recent proliferation of\nmental health discussions on social media platforms presents research\nopportunities to investigate mental health and potentially detect instances of\nmental illness. However, existing depression detection methods are constrained\ndue to two major limitations: (1) the reliance on feature engineering and (2)\nthe lack of consideration for time-varying factors. Specifically, these methods\nrequire extensive feature engineering and domain knowledge, which heavily rely\non the amount, quality, and type of user-generated content. Moreover, these\nmethods ignore the important impact of time-varying factors on depression\ndetection, such as the dynamics of linguistic patterns and interpersonal\ninteractive behaviors over time on social media (e.g., replies, mentions, and\nquote-tweets). To tackle these limitations, we propose an early depression\ndetection framework, ContrastEgo treats each user as a dynamic time-evolving\nattributed graph (ego-network) and leverages supervised contrastive learning to\nmaximize the agreement of users' representations at different scales while\nminimizing the agreement of users' representations to differentiate between\ndepressed and control groups. ContrastEgo embraces four modules, (1)\nconstructing users' heterogeneous interactive graphs, (2) extracting the\nrepresentations of users' interaction snapshots using graph neural networks,\n(3) modeling the sequences of snapshots using attention mechanism, and (4)\ndepression detection using contrastive learning. Extensive experiments on\nTwitter data demonstrate that ContrastEgo significantly outperforms the\nstate-of-the-art methods in terms of all the effectiveness metrics in various\nexperimental settings.",

One example is a phenomenon known as breast implant\nillness (BII) that has been extensively discussed on social media, though\nvaguely defined in medical literature. Objectives: The objective of this study\nis to construct a data analysis pipeline to understand emerging illness using\nsocial media data, and to apply the pipeline to understand key attributes of\nBII. Methods: We conducted a pipeline of social media data analysis using\nNatural Language Processing (NLP) and topic modeling. We extracted mentions\nrelated to signs/symptoms, diseases/disorders and medical procedures using the\nClinical Text Analysis and Knowledge Extraction System (cTAKES) from social\nmedia data. We mapped the mentions to standard medical concepts. We summarized\nmapped concepts to topics using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). Finally, we\napplied this pipeline to understand BII from several BII-dedicated social media\nsites. Results: Our pipeline identified topics related to toxicity, cancer and\nmental health issues that are highly associated with BII. Our pipeline also\nshows that cancers, autoimmune disorders and mental health problems are\nemerging concerns associated with breast implants based on social media\ndiscussions. The pipeline also identified mentions such as rupture, infection,\npain and fatigue as common self-reported issues among the public, as well as\ntoxicity from silicone implants. Conclusions: Our study could inspire future\nwork studying the suggested symptoms and factors of BII. Our study provides the\nfirst analysis and derived knowledge of BII from social media using NLP\ntechniques, and demonstrates the potential of using social media information to\nbetter understand similar emerging illnesses.",

Although\nresearchers hope that artificial intelligence can contribute to the diagnosis\nand treatment of depression, the traditional centralized machine learning needs\nto aggregate patient data, and the data privacy of patients with mental illness\nneeds to be strictly confidential, which hinders machine learning algorithms\nclinical application. To solve the problem of privacy of the medical history of\npatients with depression, we implement federated learning to analyze and\ndiagnose depression. First, we propose a general multi-view federated learning\nframework using multi-source data, which can extend any traditional machine\nlearning model to support federated learning across different institutions or\nparties. Secondly, we adopt late fusion methods to solve the problem of\ninconsistent time series of multi-view data. Finally, we compare the federated\nframework with other cooperative learning frameworks in performance and discuss\nthe related results.",

    "abstract": "This literature review involves the use of AI communication facilitators to\ndetect mood disorders such as bipolar disorder, a psychiatric condition in\nwhich patients experience drastic mood shifts. Due to the ill-defined nature of\nthe disorder, it is difficult for even a psychiatrist alone to be confident\nwith their diagnosis. Changes in mental and mood state are often highly\nsubjective and difficult to pinpoint through short-term surveys and psychiatric\nconsultations. For many patients, diagnosis and treatment based on\ntrial-and-error is unavoidable. A timely and thorough diagnosis and treatment\nplan is associated with the need for an equal involvement of both the patient\nand the psychiatrist throughout the process. This conclusion is reached through\na detailed assessment of current interventions for (i) the ill-defined nature\nof the disorder, and (ii) the trial-and-error requirement for medication and\ndiagnosis. As a result, I propose the implementation of an AI communication\nfacilitator that can aid in the appropriate diagnosis and treatment of bipolar\ndisorder by embodying the shared decision-making model. I propose that the\nmodel can be broken down into specific critical decision points with\nconsiderations made for each party involved in the process, aligning with the\nservice blueprint model. I conclude by emphasizing the importance of AI in\nbipolar disorder diagnosis and treatment due to its ability to embrace patient\nheterogeneity, and bridge the gap between mental healthcare and human-AI\ninteraction.",

AVH is fragments of the mind's creation that mostly occur in people\ndiagnosed with mental illnesses such as bipolar disorder and schizophrenia.\nAssessing the valence of hallucinated voices (i.e., how negative or positive\nvoices are) can help measure the severity of a mental illness.

This study extends the\nfocus of bias evaluation in extant work by examining bias against social\nstigmas on a large scale. It focuses on 93 stigmatized groups in the United\nStates, including a wide range of conditions related to disease, disability,\ndrug use, mental illness, religion, sexuality, socioeconomic status, and other\nrelevant factors. We investigate bias against these groups in English\npre-trained Masked Language Models (MLMs) and their downstream sentiment\nclassification tasks. To evaluate the presence of bias against 93 stigmatized\nconditions, we identify 29 non-stigmatized conditions to conduct a comparative\nanalysis. Building upon a psychology scale of social rejection, the Social\nDistance Scale, we prompt six MLMs: RoBERTa-base, RoBERTa-large, XLNet-large,\nBERTweet-base, BERTweet-large, and DistilBERT. We use human annotations to\nanalyze the predicted words from these models, with which we measure the extent\nof bias against stigmatized groups. When prompts include stigmatized\nconditions, the probability of MLMs predicting negative words is approximately\n20 percent higher than when prompts have non-stigmatized conditions. In the\nsentiment classification tasks, when sentences include stigmatized conditions\nrelated to diseases, disability, education, and mental illness, they are more\nlikely to be classified as negative. We also observe a strong correlation\nbetween bias in MLMs and their downstream sentiment classifiers (r =0.79). The\nevidence indicates that MLMs and their downstream sentiment classification\ntasks exhibit biases against socially stigmatized groups.",

Networks generated during periods of certain\nbehavioral contexts, such as variations in the daily number of locations\nvisited, were found to significantly differ from baseline networks and networks\ngenerated from randomly sampled periods of time. The framework presented here\nlays a foundation to reveal behavioural contexts and the concurrent impact of\nself-reporting at an n-of-1 level.

In many such studies, treatment\nchanges may be initiated by either the patient or by their clinician and can\nthus vary widely across patients in their timing, number, and type. Indeed, in\nthe observational longitudinal pathway of the STEP-BD study of bipolar\ndepression, one of the motivations for this work, no two patients have the same\ntreatment history even after coarsening clinic visits to a weekly time-scale.\nEstimation of an optimal treatment regime using such data is challenging as one\ncannot naively pool together patients with the same treatment history, as is\nrequired by methods based on inverse probability weighting, nor is it possible\nto apply backwards induction over the decision points, as is done in Q-learning\nand its variants. Thus, additional structure is needed to effectively pool\ninformation across patients and within a patient over time. Current scientific\ntheory for many chronic mental illnesses maintains that a patient's disease\nstatus can be conceptualized as transitioning among a small number of discrete\nstates. We use this theory to inform the construction of a partially observable\nMarkov decision process model of patient health trajectories wherein observed\nhealth outcomes are dictated by a patient's latent health state. Using this\nmodel, we derive and evaluate estimators of an optimal treatment regime under\ntwo common paradigms for quantifying long-term patient health. The finite\nsample performance of the proposed estimator is demonstrated through a series\nof simulation experiments and application to the observational pathway of the\nSTEP-BD study.

Early detection and timely intervention are crucial for\npromoting remission, preventing relapse, and alleviating the emotional and\nfinancial burdens associated with depression. However, patients with depression\noften go undiagnosed in the primary care setting. Unlike many physiological\nillnesses, depression lacks objective indicators for recognizing depression\nrisk, and existing methods for depression risk recognition are time-consuming\nand often encounter a shortage of trained medical professionals. The\ncorrelation between gait and depression risk has been empirically established.\nGait can serve as a promising objective biomarker, offering the advantage of\nefficient and convenient data collection. However, current methods for\nrecognizing depression risk based on gait have only been validated on small,\nprivate datasets, lacking large-scale publicly available datasets for research\npurposes.

Gait is a complex form of motion, and hand-crafted gait features\noften only capture a fraction of the intricate associations between gait and\ndepression risk.

Research in psychology\nrevealed that depressed users tend to be self-focused, more preoccupied with\nthemselves and ruminate more about their lives and emotions. Our work aims to\nmake use of large-scale datasets and computational methods for a quantitative\nexploration of discourse. We use the publicly available depression dataset from\nthe Early Risk Prediction on the Internet Workshop (eRisk) 2018 and extract\npart-of-speech features and several indices based on them. Our results reveal\nstatistically significant differences between the depressed and non-depressed\nindividuals confirming findings from the existing psychology literature. Our\nwork provides insights regarding the way in which depressed individuals are\nexpressing themselves on social media platforms, allowing for better-informed\ncomputational models to help monitor and prevent mental illnesses.",

There is still a gap in the scientific understanding of how\npsychological stress is expressed on social media. Stress is one of the primary\nunderlying causes and correlates of chronic physical illnesses and mental\nhealth conditions. In this paper, we explore the language of psychological\nstress with a dataset of 601 social media users, who answered the Perceived\nStress Scale questionnaire and also consented to share their Facebook and\nTwitter data. Firstly, we find that stressed users post about exhaustion,\nlosing control, increased self-focus and physical pain as compared to posts\nabout breakfast, family-time, and travel by users who are not stressed.\nSecondly, we find that Facebook language is more predictive of stress than\nTwitter language. Thirdly, we demonstrate how the language based models thus\ndeveloped can be adapted and be scaled to measure county-level trends. Since\ncounty-level language is easily available on Twitter using the Streaming API,\nwe explore multiple domain adaptation algorithms to adapt user-level Facebook\nmodels to Twitter language. We find that domain-adapted and scaled social\nmedia-based measurements of stress outperform sociodemographic variables (age,\ngender, race, education, and income), against ground-truth survey-based stress\nmeasurements, both at the user- and the county-level in the U.S. Twitter\nlanguage that scores higher in stress is also predictive of poorer health, less\naccess to facilities and lower socioeconomic status in counties.

Despite the severity of this suicide epidemic, there is so far no\nreliable and systematic way to assess suicide intent of a given individual.\nThrough efforts to automate and systematize diagnosis of mental illnesses over\nthe past few years, verbal and acoustic behaviors have received increasing\nattention as biomarkers, but little has been done to study eyelids, gaze, and\nhead pose in evaluating suicide risk. This study explores statistical analysis,\nfeature selection, and machine learning classification as means of suicide risk\nevaluation and nonverbal behavioral interpretation. Applying these methods to\nthe eye and head signals extracted from our unique dataset, this study finds\nthat high-risk suicidal individuals experience psycho-motor retardation and\nsymptoms of anxiety and depression, characterized by eye contact avoidance,\nslower blinks and a downward eye gaze. By comparing results from different\nmethods of classification, we determined that these features are highly capable\nof automatically classifying different levels of suicide risk consistently and\nwith high accuracy, above 98%. Our conclusion corroborates psychological\nstudies, and shows great potential of a systematic approach in suicide risk\nevaluation that is adoptable by both healthcare providers and naive observers.",

    "abstract": "The Early diagnosis and treatment of depression is essential for effective\ntreatment. Depression, while being one of the most common mental illnesses, is\nstill poorly understood in both research and clinical practice. Among different\ntreatments, drug prescription is widely used, however the drug treatment is not\neffective for many patients. In this work, we propose a method for major\ndepressive disorder (MDD) diagnosis as well as a method for predicting the drug\nresponse in patient with MDD using EEG signals. Method: We employ transformers,\nwhich are modified recursive neural networks with novel architecture to\nevaluate the time dependency of time series effectively. We also compare the\nmodel to the well-known deep learning schemes such as CNN, LSTM and CNN-LSTM.\nResults: The transformer achieves an average recall of 99.41% and accuracy of\n97.14% for classifying normal and MDD subjects. Furthermore, the transformer\nalso performed well in classifying responders and non-responders to the drug,\nresulting in 97.01% accuracy and 97.76% Recall. Conclusion: Outperforming other\nmethods on a similar number of parameters, the suggested technique, as a\nscreening tool, seems to have the potential to assist health care professionals\nin assessing MDD patients for early diagnosis and treatment. Significance:\nAnalyzing EEG signal analysis using transformers, which have replaced the\nrecursive models as a new structure to examine the time dependence of time\nseries, is the main novelty of this research.",

Depression detection is key for\nearly intervention to mitigate those consequences. Such a high-stake decision\ninherently necessitates interpretability. Although a few depression detection\nstudies attempt to explain the decision based on the importance score or\nattention weights, these explanations misalign with the clinical depression\ndiagnosis criterion that is based on depressive symptoms. To fill this gap, we\nfollow the computational design science paradigm to develop a novel Multi-Scale\nTemporal Prototype Network (MSTPNet). MSTPNet innovatively detects and\ninterprets depressive symptoms as well as how long they last. Extensive\nempirical analyses using a large-scale dataset show that MSTPNet outperforms\nstate-of-the-art depression detection methods with an F1-score of 0.851.

Finally, we constructed economic\nand mental distress measures to estimate structural models with lag dependent\nvariables to tease out public health policies' associational and causal path\ncoefficients on economic and mental distress. Findings From April 2020 to\nFebruary 2021, we found that anxiety and depression had steadily climbed in the\nU.S. By design, mobility restrictions primarily affected public health policies\nwhere businesses and restaurants absorbed the biggest hit. Period t-1 COVID-19\ncases increased job loss by 4.1% and economic distress by 6.3% points in the\nsame period. Job-loss and housing insecurity in t-1 increased period t mental\ndistress by 29.1% and 32.7%, respectively. However, t-1 food insecurity\ndecreased mental distress by 4.9% in time t. The pandemic-related potential\ncausal path coefficient of period t-1 economic distress on period t depression\nis 57.8%, and anxiety is 55.9%.

The false discovery rate (FDR) is a criterion that can be\nemployed to address that issue. Thus it has gained great popularity as a tool\nfor testing multiple hypotheses. Canonical correlation analysis (CCA) is a\nstatistical technique that is used to make sense of the cross-correlation of\ntwo sets of measurements collected on the same set of samples (e.g., brain\nimaging and genomic data for the same mental illness patients), and sparse CCA\nextends the classical method to high-dimensional settings.

Accumulating evidence suggests that these\neffects may be due to changes in brain development induced by environmental\nfactors. While prior work has mapped the associations between neighborhood SES\nand brain structure, little is known about the relationship between SES and\nintrinsic neural dynamics. Here, we capitalize upon a large community-based\nsample (Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort, ages 8-22 years, n=1012) to\nexamine developmental changes in functional brain network topology as estimated\nfrom resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging data. We\nquantitatively characterize this topology using a local measure of network\nsegregation known as the clustering coefficient, and find that it accounts for\na greater degree of SES-associated variance than meso-scale segregation\ncaptured by modularity. While whole-brain clustering increased with age,\nhigh-SES youth displayed faster increases in clustering than low-SES youth, and\nthis effect was most pronounced for regions in the limbic, somatomotor, and\nventral attention systems. The effect of SES on developmental increases in\nclustering was strongest for connections of intermediate physical length,\nconsistent with faster decreases in local connectivity in these regions in\nlow-SES youth, and tracked changes in BOLD signal complexity in the form of\nregional homogeneity.

In the\nmodern world, many individuals suffering from mental illness seek emotional\nsupport and advice on well-known and easily-accessible social media platforms\nsuch as Reddit. While prior artificial intelligence research has demonstrated\nthe ability to extract valuable information from social media on suicidal\nthoughts and behaviors, these efforts have not considered both severity and\ntemporality of risk.

In this work, we address this\nknowledge gap by developing deep learning algorithms to assess suicide risk in\nterms of severity and temporality from Reddit data based on the Columbia\nSuicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS). In particular, we employ two deep\nlearning approaches: time-variant and time-invariant modeling, for user-level\nsuicide risk assessment, and evaluate their performance against a\nclinician-adjudicated gold standard Reddit corpus annotated based on the\nC-SSRS. Our results suggest that the time-variant approach outperforms the\ntime-invariant method in the assessment of suicide-related ideations and\nsupportive behaviors (AUC:0.78), while the time-invariant model performed\nbetter in predicting suicide-related behaviors and suicide attempt (AUC:0.64).\nThe proposed approach can be integrated with clinical diagnostic interviews for\nimproving suicide risk assessments.",

Methods: We start with estimating and visualizing\nlinks within and among extracted multimodal data features using a Gaussian\ngraphical model (GGM). We then propose a modularity-based method that can be\napplied to the GGM to identify links that are associated with mental illness\nacross a multimodal data set.

Following the \"causal roadmap,\" we causally and statistically define the\nODTR and provide an introduction to estimating it using the ODTR SuperLearner.\nAdditionally, we highlight practical choices when implementing the algorithm,\nincluding choice of candidate algorithms, metalearners to combine the\ncandidates, and risk functions to select the best combination of algorithms.\nUsing simulations, we illustrate how estimating the ODTR using this\nSuperLearner approach can uncover treatment effect heterogeneity more\neffectively than traditional approaches based on fitting a parametric\nregression of the outcome on the treatment, covariates and treatment-covariate\ninteractions. We investigate the implications of choices in implementing an\nODTR SuperLearner at various sample sizes. Our results show the advantages of:\n(1) including a combination of both flexible machine learning algorithms and\nsimple parametric estimators in the library of candidate algorithms; (2) using\nan ensemble metalearner to combine candidates rather than selecting only the\nbest-performing candidate; (3) using the mean outcome under the rule as a risk\nfunction.

The VAE is trained on voxelwise rs-fMRI data and performs\nnon-linear dimensionality reduction that retains meaningful information. The\nretention of information in the model's representations is evaluated using\ndownstream age regression and sex classification tasks. The results on these\ntasks are highly encouraging and a linear regressor trained with the\nrepresentations of our unsupervised model performs almost as well as a\nsupervised neural network, trained specifically for age regression on the same\ndataset. The model is also evaluated with a schizophrenia diagnosis prediction\ntask, to assess its feasibility as a dimensionality reduction method for\nneuropsychiatric datasets. These results highlight the potential for\npre-training on a larger set of individuals who do not have mental illness, to\nimprove the downstream neuropsychiatric task results. The pre-trained model is\nfine-tuned for a variable number of epochs on a schizophrenia dataset and we\nfind that fine-tuning for 1 epoch yields the best results. This work therefore\nnot only opens up non-linear dimensionality reduction for voxelwise rs-fMRI\ndata but also shows that pre-training a deep learning model on voxelwise\nrs-fMRI datasets greatly increases performance even on smaller datasets. It\nalso opens up the ability to look at the distribution of rs-fMRI time series in\nthe latent space of the VAE for heterogeneous neuropsychiatric disorders like\nschizophrenia in future work. This can be complemented with the generative\naspect of the model that allows us to reconstruct points from the model's\nlatent space back into brain space and obtain an improved understanding of the\nrelation that the VAE learns between subjects, timepoints, and a subject's\ncharacteristics.",

    "abstract": "Previous researches on dialogue system assessment usually focus on the\nquality evaluation (e.g. fluency, relevance, etc) of responses generated by the\nchatbots, which are local and technical metrics. For a chatbot which responds\nto millions of online users including minors, we argue that it should have a\nhealthy mental tendency in order to avoid the negative psychological impact on\nthem. In this paper, we establish several mental health assessment dimensions\nfor chatbots (depression, anxiety, alcohol addiction, empathy) and introduce\nthe questionnaire-based mental health assessment methods. We conduct\nassessments on some well-known open-domain chatbots and find that there are\nsevere mental health issues for all these chatbots. We consider that it is due\nto the neglect of the mental health risks during the dataset building and the\nmodel training procedures. We expect to attract researchers' attention to the\nserious mental health problems of chatbots and improve the chatbots' ability in\npositive emotional interaction.",

Objective: The objective of our study was to identified\nkey requirements and features for the design of a student-centered mental\nhealth self-management tool. Methods: An interview study was first conducted to\nunderstand college students' needs and preferences on a mental health\nself-management tool. Functional information requirement analysis was then\nconducted to translate the needs into design implications. Results: A total of\n153 university students were recruited for the semi-structured interview. The\nparticipants mentioned several features including coping techniques, artificial\nintelligence, time management, tracking, and communication with others.\nParticipant's preferences on usability and privacy settings were also\ncollected.

I use random variation in\njudge assignment to compare those who were required to seek weekly mental\nhealth counseling to those who were not. The main findings are that being\nassigned to seek mental health treatment decreases the likelihood of three-year\nrecidivism by about 12 percentage points, or 36 percent. This effect persists\nover time, and is similar among various types of individuals on probation. In\naddition, I show that mental health treatment operates distinctly from drug\naddiction interventions in a multiple-treatment framework. I provide evidence\nthat mental health treatment's longer-term effectiveness is strongest among\nmore financially-advantaged probationers, consistent with this setting, in\nwhich the cost of mandated treatment is shouldered by offenders. Finally,\nconservative calculations result in a 5:1 benefit-to-cost ratio which suggests\nthat the treatment-induced decrease in future crime would be more than\nsufficient to offset the costs of treatment.",

Development of sensors and systems that can reliably track mental\nfatigue can prevent accidents, reduce errors, and help increase workplace\nproductivity. This review provides a critical summary of theoretical models of\nmental fatigue, a description of key enabling sensor technologies, and a\nsystematic review of recent studies using biosensor-based systems for tracking\nmental fatigue in humans. We conducted a systematic search and review of recent\nliterature which focused on detection and tracking of mental fatigue in humans.\nThe search yielded 57 studies (N=1082), majority of which used\nelectroencephalography (EEG) based sensors for tracking mental fatigue. We\nfound that EEG-based sensors can provide a moderate to good sensitivity for\nfatigue detection. Notably, we found no incremental benefit of using\nhigh-density EEG sensors for application in mental fatigue detection. Given the\nfindings, we provide a critical discussion on the integration of wearable EEG\nand ambient sensors in the context of achieving real-world monitoring. Future\nwork required to advance and adapt the technologies toward widespread\ndeployment of wearable sensors and systems for fatigue monitoring in\nsemi-autonomous and autonomous industries is examined.",

    "abstract": "The human brain remains continuously active, whether an individual is working\nor at rest. Mental activity is a daily process, and if the brain becomes\nexcessively active, known as overload, it can adversely affect human health.\nRecently, advancements in early prediction of mental health conditions have\nemerged, aiming to prevent serious consequences and enhance the overall quality\nof life. Consequently, the estimation of mental status has garnered significant\nattention from diverse researchers due to its potential benefits. While various\nsignals are employed to assess mental state, the electroencephalogram,\ncontaining extensive information about the brain, is widely utilized by\nresearchers. In this paper, we categorize mental workload into three states\n(low, middle, and high) and estimate a continuum of mental workload levels. Our\nmethod leverages information from multiple spatial dimensions to achieve\noptimal results in mental estimation. For the time domain approach, we employ\nTemporal Convolutional Networks. In the frequency domain, we introduce a novel\narchitecture based on combining residual blocks, termed the Multi-Dimensional\nResidual Block. The integration of these two domains yields significant results\ncompared to individual estimates in each domain. Our approach achieved a 74.98%\naccuracy in the three-class classification, surpassing the provided data\nresults at 69.00%. Specially, our method demonstrates efficacy in estimating\ncontinuous levels, evidenced by a corresponding Concordance Correlation\nCoefficient (CCC) result of 0.629.

Currently, in the largest population surveys, such as\nthose carried out by the Centers for Disease Control or Gallup, mental health\nis only broadly captured through \"mentally unhealthy days\" or \"sadness\", and\nlimited to relatively infrequent state or metropolitan estimates. Through the\nlarge scale analysis of social media data, robust estimation of population\nmental health is feasible at much higher resolutions, up to weekly estimates\nfor counties. In the present work, we validate a pipeline that uses a sample of\n1.2 billion Tweets from 2 million geo-located users to estimate mental health\nchanges for the two leading mental health conditions, depression and anxiety.\nWe find moderate to large associations between the language-based mental health\nassessments and survey scores from Gallup for multiple levels of granularity,\ndown to the county-week (fixed effects $\\beta = .25$ to $1.58$; $p<.001$).\nLanguage-based assessment allows for the cost-effective and scalable monitoring\nof population mental health at weekly time scales. Such spatially fine-grained\ntime series are well suited to monitor effects of societal events and policies\nas well as enable quasi-experimental study designs in population health and\nother disciplines. Beyond mental health in the U.S., this method generalizes to\na broad set of psychological outcomes and allows for community measurement in\nunder-resourced settings where no traditional survey measures - but social\nmedia data - are available.",

    "abstract": "New mental tasks were investigated for suitability in Brain-Computer\nInterface (BCI). Electroencephalography (EEG) signals were collected and\nanalyzed to identify these mental tasks. MS Windows-based software was\ndeveloped for investigating and classifying recorded EEG data with unnecessary\nfrequencies filtered out with Bandpass filtering. To identify the best feature\nvector construction method for a given mental task, feature vectors were\nconstructed using Bandpower, Principal Component Analysis, and Downsampling\nseparately. These feature vectors were then classified with Linear Discriminant\nAnalysis, Linear Support Vector Machines, Critical Distance Classifiers,\nNearest Neighbor Classifiers, and their Non-Linear counterparts to find the\nbest-performing classifier. For comparison purposes, performances of already\nwell-known mental tasks in the BCI community were computed along with that of\nnew mental tasks introduced in this thesis. In the preliminary studies, it was\nfound that the most promising new mental task which a BCI system could identify\nis the imagination of hitting a given square with an imaginary arrow from above\n(or below) and right, (or left) to the screen. The group of these mental tasks\nwas named as 'Hit Series' (HS). A detailed investigation of HS was carried out\nand compared with the performance of Motor Imagery (MI) events which are the\nmost heavily used mental tasks in EEG-based BCI systems. One subject achieved\nthe maximum average performance for HS, 100 pct in the binary classifications\nwhile 99 pct in overall combined performance. The best average performances of\nthe other two subjects for the same mental tasks were 93 pct and 87pct with the\noverall performance of 89 pct and 78 pct.

    "abstract": "The EmbodiedQA is a task of training an embodied agent by intelligently\nnavigating in a simulated environment and gathering visual information to\nanswer questions. Existing approaches fail to explicitly model the mental\nimagery function of the agent, while the mental imagery is crucial to embodied\ncognition, and has a close relation to many high-level meta-skills such as\ngeneralization and interpretation. In this paper, we propose a novel Mental\nImagery eNhanceD (MIND) module for the embodied agent, as well as a relevant\ndeep reinforcement framework for training. The MIND module can not only model\nthe dynamics of the environment (e.g. 'what might happen if the agent passes\nthrough a door') but also help the agent to create a better understanding of\nthe environment (e.g. 'The refrigerator is usually in the kitchen'). Such\nknowledge makes the agent a faster and better learner in locating a feasible\npolicy with only a few trails. Furthermore, the MIND module can generate mental\nimages that are treated as short-term subgoals by our proposed deep\nreinforcement framework. These mental images facilitate policy learning since\nshort-term subgoals are easy to achieve and reusable. This yields better\nplanning efficiency than other algorithms that learn a policy directly from\nprimitive actions. Finally, the mental images visualize the agent's intentions\nin a way that human can understand, and this endows our agent's actions with\nmore interpretability. The experimental results and further analysis prove that\nthe agent with the MIND module is superior to its counterparts not only in EQA\nperformance but in many other aspects such as route planning, behavioral\ninterpretation, and the ability to generalize from a few examples.",

    "abstract": "Online mental health support communities have grown in recent years for\nproviding accessible mental and emotional health support through volunteer\ncounselors. Despite millions of people participating in chat support on these\nplatforms, the clinical effectiveness of these communities on mental health\nsymptoms remains unknown. Furthermore, although volunteers receive some\ntraining based on established therapeutic skills studied in face-to-face\nenvironments such as active listening and motivational interviewing, it remains\nunderstudied how the usage of these skills in this online context affects\npeople's mental health status. In our work, we collaborate with one of the\nlargest online peer support platforms and use both natural language processing\nand machine learning techniques to measure how one-on-one support chats affect\ndepression and anxiety symptoms. We measure how the techniques and\ncharacteristics of support providers, such as using affirmation, empathy, and\npast experience on the platform, affect support-seekers' mental health changes.\nWe find that online peer support chats improve both depression and anxiety\nsymptoms with a statistically significant but relatively small effect size.\nAdditionally, support providers' techniques such as emphasizing the autonomy of\nthe client lead to better mental health outcomes. However, we also found that\nsome behaviors (e.g. persuading) are actually harmful to depression and anxiety\noutcomes. Our work provides key understanding for mental health care in the\nonline setting and designing training systems for online support providers.",

And third, ascertain whether observed effects\non the financial wellbeing of the farm were a result of interactions between\npredictor variables. This is the first report directly comparing climate change\nwith other factors potentially impacting financial wellbeing of farms. Certain\nclimate change factors, namely increases in temperature and reductions in\nprecipitation, can regionally impact self-perceived financial wellbeing of\nfruit farmers. Specifically, increases in temperature and reduction in\nprecipitation can have a measurable negative impact on the financial wellbeing\nof farms in Chile. This effect is less pronounced in Tunisia. Climate impact\ndifferences were observed within Chile but not in Tunisia. However, climate\nchange is only of minor importance for predicting farm financial wellbeing,\nespecially for farms already doing financially well. Factors that are more\nimportant, mainly in Tunisia, included trust in information sources and prior\nfarm ownership. Other important factors include farm size, water management\nsystems used and diversity of fruit crops grown. Moreover, some of the\nimportant factors identified differed between farms doing and not doing well\nfinancially. Interactions between factors may improve or worsen farm financial\nwellbeing.",

By taking a\nsystematic approach, it screens journals, conference proceedings and books on\nhow computer-based systems are used for improving both the health and wellbeing\nof the most senior individuals. By using different Internet-databases indexing\nacademic publications and a set of conceptual keywords the authors searched for\nand identified 62 major publications on the topic that were carefully reviewed.\nEach publication item was classified according different category sets and the\naggregated data was then analyzed from different socio-technological\nperspectives. Our findings suggest that research on the topic is very focused\non diseases over health and wellbeing, since most of the studied information\nsystems focused much more on the protective and curative medical procedures\nover other important dimensions such as prevention, education and health\npromotion. An overview on what and where the studied systems are used is\npresented and a new information systems research agenda is proposed.",

However, as video\nunderstanding becomes widely used in real-world applications, a key\nconsideration is developing human-centric systems that understand not only the\ncontent of the video but also how it would affect the wellbeing and emotional\nstate of viewers. To facilitate research in this setting, we introduce two\nlarge-scale datasets with over 60,000 videos manually annotated for emotional\nresponse and subjective wellbeing. The Video Cognitive Empathy (VCE) dataset\ncontains annotations for distributions of fine-grained emotional responses,\nallowing models to gain a detailed understanding of affective states. The Video\nto Valence (V2V) dataset contains annotations of relative pleasantness between\nvideos, which enables predicting a continuous spectrum of wellbeing. In\nexperiments, we show how video models that are primarily trained to recognize\nactions and find contours of objects can be repurposed to understand human\npreferences and the emotional content of videos. Although there is room for\nimprovement, predicting wellbeing and emotional response is on the horizon for\nstate-of-the-art models.

A hopeful application of these technologies is\nthat they can help businesses and workers optimize productivity and wellbeing.\nHowever, given the workplace's inherent and structural power dynamics, the\nprevalent approach of accepting tacit compliance to monitor work activities\nrather than seeking workers' meaningful consent raises privacy and ethical\nconcerns. This paper unpacks the challenges workers face when consenting to\nworkplace wellbeing technologies. Using a hypothetical case to prompt\nreflection among six multi-stakeholder focus groups involving 15 participants,\nwe explored participants' expectations and capacity to consent to these\ntechnologies. We sketched possible interventions that could better support\nmeaningful consent to workplace wellbeing technologies by drawing on critical\ncomputing and feminist scholarship -- which reframes consent from a purely\nindividual choice to a structural condition experienced at the individual level\nthat needs to be freely given, reversible, informed, enthusiastic, and specific\n(FRIES). The focus groups revealed how workers are vulnerable to \"meaningless\"\nconsent -- as they may be subject to power dynamics that minimize their ability\nto withhold consent and may thus experience an erosion of autonomy, also\nundermining the value of data gathered in the name of \"wellbeing.\" To\nmeaningfully consent, participants wanted changes to the technology and to the\npolicies and practices surrounding the technology. Our mapping of what prevents\nworkers from meaningfully consenting to workplace wellbeing technologies\n(challenges) and what they require to do so (interventions) illustrates how the\nlack of meaningful consent is a structural problem requiring socio-technical\nsolutions.",

Generative adversarial\nnetworks translated these images from one domain to the other, preserving the\nmain structure of the input image, but transforming the `style' from locations\nwhere self-reported health was bad to locations where it was good. These\ntranslations indicate that areas in Melbourne with good general health are\ncharacterised by sufficient green space and compactness of the urban\nenvironment, whilst streetscape imagery related to high social capital\ncontained more and wider footpaths, fewer fences and more grass.

A major one in the elderly population is\nthe difference in the level of skills. In this paper we report on the physical,\npsychological and social wellbeing outcomes of a novel virtual gym that enables\nonline group-exercises in older adults with different levels of skills.\n  Methods. A total of 37 older adults (65-87 years old) followed a personalized\nexercise program based on the OTAGO program for fall prevention, for a period\nof eight weeks. Participants could join online group exercises using a\ntablet-based application. Participants were assigned either to a Control group\n(individual training) or Social group (online group-exercising). Pre- and post-\nmeasurements were taken to analyze the physical, psychological and social\nwellbeing outcomes. The study received ethical approval from the CREATE-NET\nEthics Committee on ICT Research Involving Human Beings (Application N.\n2014-001).\n  Results. There were improvements in both the Social and Control groups in\nterms of physical outcomes. Interestingly though, while in the Control group\nfitter individuals tended to adhere more to the training, this was not the case\nfor the Social group, where the initial level had no effect on adherence. For\npsychological and social wellbeing outcomes there were improvements on both\ngroups, regardless of the application used.\n  Conclusion. Group exercising in a virtual gym can be effective in motivating\nand enabling individuals who are less fit to train as much as fitter\nindividuals. This not only indicates the feasibility of training together\ndespite differences in physical skills but also suggests that online exercise\ncan reduce the effect of skills on adherence in a social context.

Many did so on short notice, under\ndifficult and stressful conditions. Objective. This study investigates the\neffects of the pandemic on developers' wellbeing and productivity. Method. A\nquestionnaire survey was created mainly from existing, validated scales and\ntranslated into 12 languages. The data was analyzed using non-parametric\ninferential statistics and structural equation modeling. Results. The\nquestionnaire received 2225 usable responses from 53 countries. Factor analysis\nsupported the validity of the scales and the structural model achieved a good\nfit (CFI = 0.961, RMSEA = 0.051, SRMR = 0.067). Confirmatory results include:\n(1) the pandemic has had a negative effect on developers' wellbeing and\nproductivity; (2) productivity and wellbeing are closely related; (3) disaster\npreparedness, fear related to the pandemic and home office ergonomics all\naffect wellbeing or productivity. Exploratory analysis suggests that: (1)\nwomen, parents and people with disabilities may be disproportionately affected;\n(2) different people need different kinds of support. Conclusions. To improve\nemployee productivity, software companies should focus on maximizing employee\nwellbeing and improving the ergonomics of employees' home offices.

    "abstract": "This paper describes a fundamental and empirically conspicuous problem\ninherent to surveys of human feelings and opinions in which subjective\nresponses are elicited on numerical scales. The paper also proposes a solution.\nThe problem is a tendency by some individuals -- particularly those with low\nlevels of education -- to simplify the response scale by considering only a\nsubset of possible responses such as the lowest, middle, and highest. In\nprinciple, this ``focal value rounding'' (FVR) behavior renders invalid even\nthe weak ordinality assumption often used in analysis of such data. With\n``happiness'' or life satisfaction data as an example, descriptive methods and\na multinomial logit model both show that the effect is large and that education\nand, to a lesser extent, income level are predictors of FVR behavior.\n  A model simultaneously accounting for the underlying wellbeing and for the\ndegree of FVR is able to estimate the latent subjective wellbeing, i.e.~the\ncounterfactual full-scale responses for all respondents, the biases associated\nwith traditional estimates, and the fraction of respondents who exhibit FVR.\nAddressing this problem helps to resolve a longstanding puzzle in the life\nsatisfaction literature, namely that the returns to education, after adjusting\nfor income, appear to be small or negative. Due to the same econometric\nproblem, the marginal utility of income in a subjective wellbeing sense has\nbeen consistently underestimated.",

    "abstract": "The quantification of emotional states is an important step to understanding\nwellbeing. Time series data from multiple modalities such as physiological and\nmotion sensor data have proven to be integral for measuring and quantifying\nemotions. Monitoring emotional trajectories over long periods of time inherits\nsome critical limitations in relation to the size of the training data. This\nshortcoming may hinder the development of reliable and accurate machine\nlearning models. To address this problem, this paper proposes a framework to\ntackle the limitation in performing emotional state recognition on multiple\nmultimodal datasets: 1) encoding multivariate time series data into coloured\nimages; 2) leveraging pre-trained object recognition models to apply a Transfer\nLearning (TL) approach using the images from step 1; 3) utilising a 1D\nConvolutional Neural Network (CNN) to perform emotion classification from\nphysiological data; 4) concatenating the pre-trained TL model with the 1D CNN.\nFurthermore, the possibility of performing TL to infer stress from\nphysiological data is explored by initially training a 1D CNN using a large\nphysical activity dataset and then applying the learned knowledge to the target\ndataset. We demonstrate that model performance when inferring real-world\nwellbeing rated on a 5-point Likert scale can be enhanced using our framework,\nresulting in up to 98.5% accuracy, outperforming a conventional CNN by 4.5%.\nSubject-independent models using the same approach resulted in an average of\n72.3% accuracy (SD 0.038).

    "abstract": "Global environmental change is pushing many socio-environmental systems\ntowards critical thresholds, where ecological systems' states are on the\nprecipice of tipping points and interventions are needed to navigate or avert\nimpending transitions. Flickering, where a system vacillates between\nalternative stable states, is touted as a useful early warning signal of\nirreversible transitions to undesirable ecological regimes. However, while\nflickering may presage an ecological tipping point, these dynamics also pose\nunique challenges for human adaptation. In this work, we link an ecological\nmodel that can exhibit flickering to a model of human adaptation to a changing\nenvironment. This allows us to explore the impact of flickering on the utility\nof adaptive agents in a coupled socio-environmental system. We highlight the\nconditions under which flickering causes wellbeing to decline\ndisproportionately, and explore how these dynamics impact the optimal timing of\na transformational change that partially decouples wellbeing from environmental\nvariability. The implications of flickering on nomadic communities in Mongolia,\nartisanal fisheries, and wildfire systems are explored as possible case\nstudies. Flickering, driven in part by climate change and changes to governance\nsystems, may already be impacting communities. We argue that governance\ninterventions investing in adaptive capacity could blunt the negative impact of\nflickering that can occur as socio-environmental systems pass through tipping\npoints, and therefore contribute to the sustainability of these systems.",

Based on the\ninfluence of space design on a user and combining that with the dynamic\naffordances of virtual spaces, we present the idea of adaptive virtual\nneuroarchitecture (AVN), where virtual environments respond to the user and the\nuser's real world context while simultaneously influencing them both in\nrealtime. To show how AVN has been explored in current research, we present a\nsampling of recent work that demonstrates reciprocal relationships using\nphysical affordances (space, objects), the user's state (physiological,\ncognitive, emotional), and the virtual world used in the design of novel\nvirtual reality experiences. We believe AVN has the potential to help us learn\nhow to design spaces and environments that can enhance the wellbeing of their\ninhabitants.",

    "abstract": "Around ten percent of children may present with a disorder where language\ndoes not develop as expected. This often affects vocabulary skills, i.e.,\nfinding the words to express wants, needs and ideas, which can influence\nbehaviours linked to wellbeing and daily functioning, such as concentration,\nindependence, social interactions and managing emotions. Without specialist\nsupport, needs can increase in severity and continue to adulthood.\n  The type of support, known as interventions, showing strongest evidence for\nimproving vocabulary with some signs of improved behaviour and wellbeing are\nones that use word webs. These are diagrams consisting of lines that connect\nsound and meaning information about a word to strengthen the child's word\nknowledge and use. The diagrams resemble what is commonly known as mind-maps\nand are widely used by Speech and Language Therapists in partnership with\nschool educators to help children with language difficulties. In addition,\ninterventions delivered through mobile-devices has led in some cases to\nincreased vocabulary gains with positive influence on wellbeing and academic\nattainment.\n  With advances in technology and availability of user-friendly mobile devices\nto capture, combine and replay multimedia, new opportunities for designing\nbespoke vocabulary instruction have emerged that are without timing and\nlocation constraints. This brings the potential to engage and motivate users\nand harbour independence through functional strategies that support each\nchild's unique language needs. To achieve this, children with language\ndisorder, their parents/carers, support professionals and software development\nteam members must work jointly to create an intervention that is fit for\npurpose. This is the first research planned to explore the collaborative\ndevelopment and acceptability of a digitally enhanced vocabulary intervention\nfor child language disorder.",

As the gross domestic\nproduct (GDP) has been regarded as a dated measure and tool for benchmarking a\nnation's economic performance, there has been a growing consensus for an\nalternative measure---such as a composite `wellbeing' index---to holistically\ncapture a country's socioeconomic health performance. Many conventional ways of\nconstructing wellbeing/health indices involve combining different observable\nmetrics, such as life expectancy and education level, to form an index.\nHowever, health is inherently latent with metrics actually being observable\nindicators of health. In contrast to the GDP or other conventional health\nindices, our approach provides a holistic quantification of the overall\n`health' of a nation. We build upon the latent health factor index (LHFI)\napproach that has been used to assess the unobservable ecological/ecosystem\nhealth. This framework integratively models the relationship between metrics,\nthe latent health, and the covariates that drive the notion of health. In this\npaper, the LHFI structure is integrated with spatial modeling and statistical\ncausal modeling, so as to evaluate the impact of a policy variable (mandatory\nmaternity leave days) on a nation's socioeconomic health, while formally\naccounting for spatial dependency among the nations. We apply our model to\ncountries around the world using data on various metrics and potential\ncovariates pertaining to different aspects of societal health.

    "abstract": "We address an inherent difficulty in welfare-theoretic fair machine learning\nby proposing an equivalently axiomatically-justified alternative and studying\nthe resulting computational and statistical learning questions. Welfare metrics\nquantify overall wellbeing across a population of one or more groups, and\nwelfare-based objectives and constraints have recently been proposed to\nincentivize fair machine learning methods to produce satisfactory solutions\nthat consider the diverse needs of multiple groups. Unfortunately, many\nmachine-learning problems are more naturally cast as loss minimization tasks,\nrather than utility maximization, which complicates direct application of\nwelfare-centric methods to fair machine learning. In this work, we define a\ncomplementary measure, termed malfare, measuring overall societal harm (rather\nthan wellbeing), with axiomatic justification via the standard axioms of\ncardinal welfare. We then cast fair machine learning as malfare minimization\nover the risk values (expected losses) of each group. Surprisingly, the axioms\nof cardinal welfare (malfare) dictate that this is not equivalent to simply\ndefining utility as negative loss. Building upon these concepts, we define\nfair-PAC (FPAC) learning, where an FPAC learner is an algorithm that learns an\n$\\varepsilon$-$\\delta$ malfare-optimal model with bounded sample complexity,\nfor any data distribution, and for any (axiomatically justified) malfare\nconcept. Finally, we show broad conditions under which, with appropriate\nmodifications, standard PAC-learners may be converted to FPAC learners. This\nplaces FPAC learning on firm theoretical ground, as it yields statistical and\ncomputational efficiency guarantees for many well-studied machine-learning\nmodels, and is also practically relevant, as it democratizes fair ML by\nproviding concrete training algorithms and rigorous generalization guarantees\nfor these models",

    "abstract": "This paper is motivated by the analysis of a survey study of college student\nwellbeing before and after the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. A statistical\nchallenge in well-being survey studies lies in that outcome variables are often\nrecorded in different scales, be it continuous, binary, or ordinal. The\npresence of mixed data complicates the assessment of the associations between\nthem while adjusting for covariates. In our study, of particular interest are\nthe associations between college students' wellbeing and other mental health\nmeasures and how other risk factors moderate these associations during the\npandemic. To this end, we propose a unifying framework for studying partial\nassociation between mixed data. This is achieved by defining a unified residual\nusing the surrogate method. The idea is to map the residual randomness to the\nsame continuous scale, regardless of the original scales of outcome variables.\nIt applies to virtually all commonly used models for covariate adjustments. We\ndemonstrate the validity of using such defined residuals to assess partial\nassociation. In particular, we develop a measure that generalizes classical\nKendall's tau in the sense that it can size both partial and marginal\nassociations. More importantly, our development advances the theory of the\nsurrogate method developed in recent years by showing that it can be used\nwithout requiring outcome variables having a latent variable structure. The use\nof our method in the well-being survey analysis reveals (i) significant\nmoderation effects (i.e., the difference between partial and marginal\nassociations) of some key risk factors; and (ii) an elevated moderation effect\nof physical health, loneliness, and accommodation after the onset of COVID-19.",

Therefore, within the\nproject HorizonUAM of the German Aerospace Center (DLR), we investigated\npassengers' acceptance of air taxis. One challenge is that not many people have\nreal experiences with urban air mobility (UAM) at the moment and thus\nrequirements formulated by potential users refer to rather abstract concepts.\nTo allow participants to gain realistic impressions of UAM concepts, a Mixed\nReality (MR) Air Taxi Simulator was set up. In a study, 30 participants\nexperienced an inner-city business shuttle flight. We assessed the influence of\nanother person on board on wellbeing and information needs in nominal\n(experiment 1) and non-nominal situations (experiment 2). For the latter,\nparticipants experienced a re-routing of the flight due to landing side\nunavailability. During and after the flights, participants answered\nquestionnaires and extensive interviews were conducted. The study produced\nempirical data on relevant factors regarding interaction, information needs and\ncomfort within an air taxi. The findings show that passengers want to be\ninformed about intentions of the vehicle. The presence of a flight attendant on\nboard is not necessary but can increase wellbeing especially during non-nominal\nsituations.",

The concept of resourcefulness highlights the ability of humans to\nrepurpose objects spontaneously for a different use case than was initially\nintended. It is a crucial element for human health and wellbeing, which is of\ngreat interest for various aspects of HCI and design research.

    "abstract": "Raking is widely used in categorical data modeling and survey practice but\nfaced with methodological and computational challenges. We develop a Bayesian\nparadigm for raking by incorporating the marginal constraints as a prior\ndistribution via two main strategies: 1) constructing the solution subspaces\nvia basis functions or projection matrix and 2) modeling soft constraints. The\nproposed Bayes-raking estimation integrates the models for the margins, the\nsample selection and response mechanism, and the outcome, with the capability\nto propagate all sources of uncertainty. Computation is done via Stan, and\ncodes are ready for public use. Simulation studies show that Bayes-raking can\nperform as well as raking with large samples and outperform in terms of\nvalidity and efficiency gains, especially with a sparse contingency table or\ndependent raking factors. We apply the new method to the Longitudinal Study of\nWellbeing study and demonstrate that model-based approaches significantly\nimprove inferential reliability and substantive findings as a unified survey\ninference framework.",

We then operationalised these\nqualities as a set of design goals - Assured Anonymity, Constructive\nModeration, Adequate Slowness and Controlled Access - in the design and\ndevelopment of a secure anonymous employee voice system. Our novel take on the\nEnterprise Social Network aims to foster good citizenship whilst also promoting\nfrank yet constructive discussion. We reflect on a two-week deployment of our\nsystem, the diverse range of candid discussions that emerged around important\nworkplace issues and the potential for change within the host organization. We\nconclude by reflecting on the ways in which our approach shaped the discourse\nand supported the creation of a trusted environment for employee voice.",

Leveraging this information source requires new\ntools to be developed to facilitate data-driven research for sleep and activity\npatient-recommendations.\n  In this paper we explore the use of deep learning to build sleep quality\nprediction models based on actigraphy data. We first use deep learning as a\npure model building device by performing human activity recognition (HAR) on\nraw sensor data, and using deep learning to build sleep prediction models. We\ncompare the deep learning models with those build using classical approaches,\ni.e. logistic regression, support vector machines, random forest and adaboost.\nSecondly, we employ the advantage of deep learning with its ability to handle\nhigh dimensional datasets. We explore several deep learning models on the raw\nwearable sensor output without performing HAR or any other feature extraction.\n  Our results show that using a convolutional neural network on the raw\nwearables output improves the predictive value of sleep quality from physical\nactivity, by an additional 8% compared to state-of-the-art non-deep learning\napproaches, which itself shows a 15% improvement over current practice.\nMoreover, utilizing deep learning on raw data eliminates the need for data\npre-processing and simplifies the overall workflow to analyze actigraphy data\nfor sleep and physical activity research.",

    "abstract": "Changing dietary habits and keeping food diary encourages fewer calorie\nconsumption, and thus weight loss. Studies have shown that people who keep food\ndiary are more successful in losing weight and keeping it off. However, no\nstudy has investigated the nutritional values produced by food journaling\napplications. This is crucial since keeping food diaries helps identify areas\nwhere changes needed to help user's loss weight, based on the application\nfeedback. To achieve this, the provided data should be consistent among all\napplications. Otherwise, this will question the effectiveness and reliability\nof such tools in tracking diet and weight loss, and hence question user trust\nin these applications. This study characterizes the use of 4 food journaling\napplications to track user diet for 10 days (namely, MyFitnessPal, Lose It,\nFatSecret, CRONOMeter). We measured variations between the output of each\napplication. The findings revealed an inconsistent and a variation in the\noutput feedback given by all the 4 tools. Although some tools provided closer\nvalues, still their data were different and inconsistent. Moreover, some tools\nwere missing essential nutritional fact data, such as sugar and fiber. We\nadditionally compared a sample of food items common among all tools with the\nSwiss Food Composition Database and checked for their consistency with the same\nitems in the database. The evaluation of the applications showed a gap in the\ndata consistency among applications and the FCD, and questions how reliable\nthey are for food logging and diet tracking. This study contributes to current\nresearch in health and wellbeing and can be referenced by researchers to\nprovide deeper insights into the data consistency. Future work should examine\nways to provide precise output that is common among all applications, so to\nguarantee the effect on weight loss.",

However, these algorithms are commonly compared against weak\nbaselines, which may contribute to excessive optimism. To assess how well an\nalgorithm works, scientists typically ask how well its output correlates with\nmedically assigned scores. Here we perform a meta-analysis to quantify how the\nliterature evaluates their algorithms for monitoring mental wellbeing. We find\nthat the bulk of the literature ($\\sim$77%) uses meaningless comparisons that\nignore patient baseline state. For example, having an algorithm that uses phone\ndata to diagnose mood disorders would be useful. However, it is possible to\nover 80% of the variance of some mood measures in the population by simply\nguessing that each patient has their own average mood - the patient-specific\nbaseline. Thus, an algorithm that just predicts that our mood is like it\nusually is can explain the majority of variance, but is, obviously, entirely\nuseless. Comparing to the wrong (population) baseline has a massive effect on\nthe perceived quality of algorithms and produces baseless optimism in the\nfield.

Hearing impairment impacts negatively on\none's education, financial success [2][3], cognitive development in childhood\n[4], including increased risk of dementia in older adulthood [5]. Lack of or\nreduced social interaction due to hearing impairment affects creating or\nmaintaining healthy relationships at home, school and work [5]. Hence, hearing\nimpairment genuinely affects the overall quality of life and wellbeing.\n  The cocktail party effect, which is a healthy hearing individual's ability to\nunderstand one voice in a cacophony of other voices or sounds, is an important\nability lacking in people with hearing impairment. This inability results in\ndifficulties with simple daily activities such as partaking in group\ndiscussions or conversing in noisy restaurants [6]. This smart hearing aid aims\nto provide much-needed assistance with understanding speech in noisy\nenvironments. For example, if a person wants to partake in a group discussion,\nhe/she needs to place the microphone array based unit on a flat surface in\nfront of him/her, such as a table. When conversations take place, the\nmicrophone array will capture and process sound from all directions,\nintelligently prioritise and provide the lead speaker's voice by suppressing\nunwanted noises, including speeches of other people. This device selects and\nalternates voices between speakers automatically using voice algorithms.\nAdditionally, the user has the option of further fine-tuning the acoustic\nparameters as needed through a smartphone interface.

Strong social bonds are essential for health and wellbeing, but often\nhealth conditions can detrimentally affect a person's ability to interact with\nothers. This can become a vicious cycle resulting in further decline in health.\nFor this reason, the social management of health is an important aspect of\nhealthcare. We propose that socially assistive robots (SARs) could help people\nwith health conditions maintain positive social lives by supporting them in\nsocial interactions. This paper makes three contributions, as detailed below.\nWe develop a framework of social mediation functions that robots could perform,\nmotivated by the special social needs that people with health conditions have.\nIn this framework we identify five types of functions that SARs could perform:\na) changing how the person is perceived, b) enhancing the social behavior of\nthe person, c) modifying the social behavior of others, d) providing structure\nfor interactions, and e) changing how the person feels. We thematically\norganize and review the existing literature on robots supporting human-human\ninteractions, in both clinical and non-clinical settings, and explain how the\nfindings and design ideas from these studies can be applied to the functions\nidentified in the framework. Finally, we point out and discuss challenges in\ndesigning SARs for supporting social interactions, and highlight opportunities\nfor future robot design and HRI research on the mediator role of robots.",

    "abstract": "Individual migration has been regarded as an important factor for the\nevolution of cooperation in mobile populations. Motivations of migration,\nhowever, can be largely divergent: one is highly frustrated by the vicinity of\nan exploiter or defector, while other enthusiastically searches cooperator\nmates. Albeit both extreme attitudes are observed in human behavior, but their\nspecific impacts on wellbeing remained unexplored. In this work, we propose an\norientation-driven migration approach for mobile individuals in combination\nwith the mentioned migration preferences and study their roles in the\ncooperation level in a two-dimensional public goods game. We find that\ncooperation can be greatly promoted when individuals are more inclined to\nescape away from their defective neighbors. On the contrary, cooperation cannot\nbe effectively maintained when individuals are more motivated to approach their\ncooperative neighbors. In addition, compared with random migration, movement by\nleaving defectors can promote cooperation more effectively. By means of\ntheoretical analysis and numerical calculations, we further find that when\nindividuals only choose to escape away from their defective neighbors, the\naverage distance between cooperators and defectors can be enlarged, hence the\nnatural invasion of defection can be efficiently blocked. Our work, thus,\nprovides further insight on how different migration preferences influence the\nevolution of cooperation in the unified framework of spatially social games.",

Such issues may vary from\nfatigue, asthma, stroke, to even heart attack, yet they can be adequately\nindicated by vital signs and abnormal activities. Therefore, in-vehicle vital\nsign monitoring can help us predict and hence prevent these issues. Whereas\nexisting sensor-based (including camera) methods could be used to detect these\nindicators, privacy concern and system complexity both call for a convenient\nyet effective and robust alternative. This paper aims to develop V2iFi, an\nintelligent system performing monitoring tasks using a COTS impulse radio\nmounted on the windshield. V2iFi is capable of reliably detecting driver's\nvital signs under driving condition and with the presence of passengers, thus\nallowing for potentially inferring corresponding health issues.

We evaluate V2iFi both in lab environments and during\nreal-life road tests; the results demonstrate that respiratory rate, heart\nrate, and heart rate variability can all be estimated accurately.

This paper introduces the 3C concept, an integrative\nmulti-system and multi-stakeholder optimization approach for managing\ninfrastructure interventions (e.g., maintenance, renovation, etc.). The\nproposed approach takes advantage of the benefits achieved by grouping (i.e.,\noptimizing) intervention activities. Intervention optimization leads to\nsubstantial savings on both direct intervention costs (operator) and indirect\nunavailability costs (society) by reducing the number of system interruptions.\nThe proposed optimization approach is formalized into a structured mathematical\nmodel that can account for the interactions between multiple infrastructure\nnetworks and the impact on multiple stakeholders (e.g., society and\ninfrastructure operators), and it can accommodate different types of\nintervention, such as maintenance, removal, and upgrading. The different types\nof interdependencies, within and across infrastructures, are modeled using a\nproposed interaction matrix (IM). The IM allows integrating the interventions\nof different infrastructure networks whose interventions are normally planned\nindependently. Moreover, the introduced 3C concept accounts for central\ninterventions, which are those that must occur at a pre-established time\nmoment, where neither delay nor advance is permitted. To demonstrate the\napplicability of the proposed approach, an illustrative example of a\nmulti-system and multi-actor intervention planning is introduced. Results show\na substantial reduction in the operator and societal costs. In addition, the\noptimal intervention program obtained in the analysis shows no predictable\npatterns, which indicates it is a useful managerial decision support tool.",

As\nthe use of ADS in health expands, it is probable that these hazards will\nmanifest more widely.

    "abstract": "In this chapter we argue that discourses on AI must transcend the language of\n'ethics' and engage with power and political economy in order to constitute\n'Good Data'. In particular, we must move beyond the depoliticised language of\n'ethics' currently deployed (Wagner 2018) in determining whether AI is 'good'\ngiven the limitations of ethics as a frame through which AI issues can be\nviewed. In order to circumvent these limits, we use instead the language and\nconceptualisation of 'Good Data', as a more expansive term to elucidate the\nvalues, rights and interests at stake when it comes to AI's development and\ndeployment, as well as that of other digital technologies. Good Data\nconsiderations move beyond recurring themes of data protection/privacy and the\nFAT (fairness, transparency and accountability) movement to include explicit\npolitical economy critiques of power. Instead of yet more ethics principles\n(that tend to say the same or similar things anyway), we offer four 'pillars'\non which Good Data AI can be built: community, rights, usability and politics.\nOverall we view AI's 'goodness' as an explicly political (economy) question of\npower and one which is always related to the degree which AI is created and\nused to increase the wellbeing of society and especially to increase the power\nof the most marginalized and disenfranchised. We offer recommendations and\nremedies towards implementing 'better' approaches towards AI.

The LES results show complex flow dynamics around\nthe buildings of various heights and, consequently, complicated contaminant\ntransport processes from a source-point which is located in front of the New\nYork Stock Exchange building at 30 m above ground. The flow tends to align with\nthe streets that are fairly parallel to the wind direction creating\nhigh-velocity core regions, while the airflow loses its momentum markedly\nfarther downwind in the urban area.

When the source is removed, contaminants that are trapped in\nthe low-momentum urban area linger to exit the flow domain.",

One of the most immediate needs of people affected by a\ndisaster is finding shelter. While the proliferation of data on disasters is\nalready helping to save lives, identifying damages in buildings, assessing\nshelter needs, and finding appropriate places to establish emergency shelters\nor settlements require a wide range of data to be combined rapidly. To address\nthis gap and make a headway in comprehensive assessments, this paper proposes a\nmachine learning workflow that aims to fuse and rapidly analyse multimodal\ndata. This workflow is built around open and online data to ensure scalability\nand broad accessibility. Based on a database of 19 characteristics for more\nthan 200 disasters worldwide, a fusion approach at the decision level was used.\nThis technique allows the collected multimodal data to share a common semantic\nspace that facilitates the prediction of individual variables. Each fused\nnumerical vector was fed into an unsupervised clustering algorithm called\nSelf-Organizing-Maps (SOM). The trained SOM serves as a predictor for future\ncases, allowing predicting consequences such as total deaths, total people\naffected, and total damage, and provides specific recommendations for\nassessments in the shelter and housing sector. To achieve such prediction, a\nsatellite image from before the disaster and the geographic and demographic\nconditions are shown to the trained model, which achieved a prediction accuracy\nof 62 %",

A simple yet\neffective binary classification algorithm that follows this strategy is\ntwo-naive-Bayes (2NB), which enforces statistical parity - requiring that the\ngroups comprising the dataset receive positive labels with the same likelihood.\nIn this paper, we generalise this algorithm into N-naive-Bayes (NNB) to\neliminate the simplification of assuming only two sensitive groups in the data\nand instead apply it to an arbitrary number of groups.\n  We propose an extension of the original algorithm's statistical parity\nconstraint and the post-processing routine that enforces statistical\nindependence of the label and the single sensitive attribute. Then, we\ninvestigate its application on data with multiple sensitive features and\npropose a new constraint and post-processing routine to enforce differential\nfairness, an extension of established group-fairness constraints focused on\nintersectionalities. We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of the NNB\nalgorithm on US Census datasets and compare its accuracy and debiasing\nperformance, as measured by disparate impact and DF-$\\epsilon$ score, with\nsimilar group-fairness algorithms.

    "abstract": "Health disparity research often evaluates health outcomes across demographic\nsubgroups. Multilevel regression and poststratification (MRP) is a popular\napproach for small subgroup estimation due to its ability to stabilize\nestimates by fitting multilevel models and to adjust for selection bias by\npoststratifying on auxiliary variables, which are population characteristics\npredictive of the analytic outcome. However, the granularity and quality of the\nestimates produced by MRP are limited by the availability of the auxiliary\nvariables' joint distribution; data analysts often only have access to the\nmarginal distributions. To overcome this limitation, we embed the estimation of\npopulation cell counts needed for poststratification into the MRP workflow:\nembedded MRP (EMRP). Under EMRP, we generate synthetic populations of the\nauxiliary variables before implementing MRP. All sources of estimation\nuncertainty are propagated with a fully Bayesian framework. Through simulation\nstudies, we compare different methods and demonstrate EMRP's improvements over\nalternatives on the bias-variance tradeoff to yield valid subpopulation\ninferences of interest. As an illustration, we apply EMRP to the Longitudinal\nSurvey of Wellbeing and estimate food insecurity prevalence among vulnerable\ngroups in New York City. We find that all EMRP estimators can correct for the\nbias in classical MRP while maintaining lower standard errors and narrower\nconfidence intervals than directly imputing with the WFPBB and design-based\nestimates. Performances from the EMRP estimators do not differ substantially\nfrom each other, though we would generally recommend the WFPBB-MRP for its\nconsistently high coverage rates.",

Using changes in the\nnumber of Facebook users before, during, and after the disaster, community\nresilience is quantified as a function of the magnitude of impact and the time\nto recover from the extreme situation. Based on the resilience function, the\ntransient loss of resilience in population activity is measured for the\naffected communities in Louisiana. The loss in resilience of the affected\ncommunities are explained by three types of factors, including disruption in\nphysical infrastructures, disaster conditions due to hurricanes, and\nsocio-economic characteristics. A greater loss in community resilience is\nassociated with factors such as disruptions in power and transportation\nservices and disaster conditions. Socioeconomic disparities in loss of\nresilience are found with respect to median income of a community.\nUnderstanding community resilience using decreased population activity levels\ndue to a disaster and the factors associated with losses in resilience will\nenable us improve hazard preparedness, enhance disaster management practices,\nand create better recovery policies towards strengthening infrastructure and\ncommunity resilience.",

    "abstract": "There is a strong demand for virtual reality (VR) to bring quality healthcare\nto underserved populations. This paper addresses this need with the design and\nprototype of SURVIVRS: Surround Video-Based Virtual Reality for Surgery\nGuidance. SURVIVRS allows a remote specialist to guide a local surgery team\nthrough a virtual reality (VR) telepresence interface. SURVIVRS is motivated by\na need for medical expertise in remote and hard-to-reach areas, such as\nlow-to-middle-income countries (LMICs). The remote surgeon interface allows the\nlive observation of a procedure and combines 3D user interface annotation and\ncommunication tools on streams of the surgical site and the patient vitals\nmonitor. SURVIVRS also supports debriefing and educational experiences by\noffering the ability for users to watch recorded surgeries from the point of\nview of the remote expert. The main contributions of this work are: the\nfeasibility demonstration of the SURVIVRS system through a rigorous 3D user\ninterface design process; the implementation of a prototype application that\nrealizes the proposed design; and a usability evaluation of SURVIVRS showing\nthat the tool was highly favored by users from the general population.

    "abstract": "Abdominal sounds (ABS) have been traditionally used for assessing\ngastrointestinal (GI) disorders. However, the assessment requires a trained\nmedical professional to perform multiple abdominal auscultation sessions, which\nis resource-intense and may fail to provide an accurate picture of patients'\ncontinuous GI wellbeing. This has generated a technological interest in\ndeveloping wearables for continuous capture of ABS, which enables a fuller\npicture of patient's GI status to be obtained at reduced cost. This paper seeks\nto evaluate the feasibility of extracting heart rate (HR) from such ABS\nmonitoring devices. The collection of HR directly from these devices would\nenable gathering vital signs alongside GI data without the need for additional\nwearable devices, providing further cost benefits and improving general\nusability. We utilised a dataset containing 104 hours of ABS audio, collected\nfrom the abdomen using an e-stethoscope, and electrocardiogram as ground truth.\nOur evaluation shows for the first time that we can successfully extract HR\nfrom audio collected from a wearable on the abdomen. As heart sounds collected\nfrom the abdomen suffer from significant noise from GI and respiratory tracts,\nwe leverage wavelet denoising for improved heart beat detection. The mean\nabsolute error of the algorithm for average HR is 3.4 BPM with mean directional\nerror of -1.2 BPM over the whole dataset. A comparison to\nphotoplethysmography-based wearable HR sensors shows that our approach exhibits\ncomparable accuracy to consumer wrist-worn wearables for average and\ninstantaneous heart rate.",

    "abstract": "Catastrophic tornadoes cause severe damage and are a threat to human\nwellbeing, making it critical to determine mitigation strategies to reduce\ntheir impact. One such strategy, following recent research, is to retrofit\nexisting structures. To this end, in this article we propose a model that\nconsiders a decision-maker (a government agency or a public-private consortium)\nwho seeks to allocate resources to retrofit and recover wood-frame residential\nstructures, to minimize the population dislocation due to an uncertain tornado.\nIn the first stage the decision-maker selects the retrofitting strategies, and\nin the second stage the recovery decisions are made after observing the\ntornado. As tornado paths cannot be forecast reliably, we take a worst-case\napproach to uncertainty where paths are modeled as arbitrary line segments on\nthe plane. Under the assumption that an area is affected if it is sufficiently\nclose to the tornado path, the problem is framed as a two-stage robust\noptimization problem with a mixed-integer non-linear uncertainty set. We solve\nthis problem by using a decomposition column-and-constraint generation\nalgorithm that solves a two-level integer problem at each iteration. This\nproblem, in turn, is solved by a decomposition branch-and-cut method that\nexploits the geometry of the uncertainty set. To illustrate the model's\napplicability, we present a case study based on Joplin, Missouri. Our results\nshow that there can be up to 20 percent reductions in worst-case population\ndislocation by investing 15 million dollars in retrofitting and recovery; that\nour approach outperforms other retrofitting policies, and that the model is not\nover-conservative.",

In turn, such AI could have the\npotential of leading to a scenario in which there is serious global-scale\ndamage to human wellbeing.

We have\ndrawn on wide-ranging literature detailing risks to workers, and categorised\nrisks as being to worker value, power, and wellbeing. The contribution of our\nframework is to additionally consider (i) the consequences of these systems\nthat are of moral import: commodification, appropriation, concentration of\npower, and marginalisation, and (ii) the mechanisms, which represent how these\nconsequences may take effect in the system. The mechanisms are a means of\ncontextualising risk within specific system processes, which is critical for\nmitigation. This framework is aimed at helping practitioners involved in the\ndesign and deployment of AI-mediated knowledge access systems to consider the\nrisks introduced to workers, identify the precise system mechanisms that\nintroduce those risks and begin to approach mitigation.

Our methodology is based on the classic\nsusceptible-infected-removed (SIR) model and can track the evolution of\ninfections in communities, where we (a) allow for the susceptible and infected\npopulations to be reset at times where surges, outbreaks or secondary waves\nappear in the recorded data sets, (b) consider the parameters in the SIR model\nthat represent the effective transmission and recovery rates to be functions of\ntime and (c) estimate the number of deaths by combining the model solutions\nwith the recorded data sets to approximate them between consecutive surges,\noutbreaks or secondary waves, providing a more accurate estimate. We report on\nthe status of the current infections in these countries and states, and the\ninfections and deaths in India and Japan. Our model can adapt to the recorded\ndata and can be used to explain them and importantly, to forecast the number of\ninfected, recovered, removed and dead individuals, as well as it can estimate\nthe effective infection and recovery rates as functions of time, assuming an\noutbreak occurs at a given time. The latter can be used to forecast the future\nreproduction number and together with the forecast on the number of infected\nand dead individuals, our approach can be used to suggest the implementation of\nintervention strategies and mitigation policies to keep at bay the number of\ninfected and dead individuals. This can help reduce the impact of the spread\naround the world and improve the wellbeing of people.",

    "abstract": "The Anthropocene is characterized by close interdependencies between the\nnatural Earth system and the human society, posing novel challenges to model\ndevelopment. Here we present a conceptual model describing the long-term\ncoevolution of natural and socioeconomic subsystems of Earth. While the climate\nis represented via a global carbon cycle, we use economic concepts to model\nsocio-metabolic flows of biomass and fossil fuels between nature and society. A\nwellbeing-dependent parametrization of fertility and mortality governs human\npopulation dynamics. Our analysis focuses on assessing possible asymptotic\nstates of the Earth system for a qualitative understanding of its complex\ndynamics rather than quantitative predictions. Low dimension and simple\nequations enable a parameter-space analysis allowing us to identify\npreconditions of several asymptotic states and hence fates of humanity and\nplanet. These include a sustainable co-evolution of nature and society, a\nglobal collapse and everlasting oscillations. We consider scenarios\ncorresponding to different socio-cultural stages of human history. The\nnecessity of accounting for the \"human factor\" in Earth system models is\nhighlighted by the fact that carbon stocks during the past centuries evolved\nopposing to what would \"naturally\" be expected on a planet without humans. The\nintensity of biomass use and the contribution of ecosystem services to human\nwell-being are found to be crucial determinants of the asymptotic state in a\nbiomass-only scenario. The capitalistic, fossil-based scenario reveals that\ntrajectories with fundamentally different asymptotic states might still be\nalmost indistinguishable during a very long transient phase. Given current\npopulation levels, our study also supports the claim that besides reducing the\nglobal demand for energy, only the extensive use of renewable energies may pave\nthe way into a sustainable future.",

    "abstract": "Longitudinal interaction studies with Socially Assistive Robots are crucial\nto ensure that the robot is relevant for long-term use and its perceptions are\nnot prone to the novelty effect. In this paper, we present a dynamic Bayesian\nnetwork (DBN) to capture the longitudinal interactions participants had with a\nteleoperated robot coach (RC) delivering mindfulness sessions. The DBN model is\nused to study complex, temporal interactions between the participants\nself-reported personality traits, weekly baseline wellbeing scores, session\nratings, and facial AUs elicited during the sessions in a 5-week longitudinal\nstudy. DBN modelling involves learning a graphical representation that\nfacilitates intuitive understanding of how multiple components contribute to\nthe longitudinal changes in session ratings corresponding to the perceptions of\nthe RC, and participants relaxation and calm levels. The learnt model captures\nthe following within and between sessions aspects of the longitudinal\ninteraction study: influence of the 5 personality dimensions on the facial AU\nstates and the session ratings, influence of facial AU states on the session\nratings, and the influences within the items of the session ratings. The DBN\nstructure is learnt using first 3 time points and the obtained model is used to\npredict the session ratings of the last 2 time points of the 5-week\nlongitudinal data. The predictions are quantified using subject-wise RMSE and\nR2 scores. We also demonstrate two applications of the model, namely,\nimputation of missing values in the dataset and estimation of longitudinal\nsession ratings of a new participant with a given personality profile. The\nobtained DBN model thus facilitates learning of conditional dependency\nstructure between variables in the longitudinal data and offers inferences and\nconceptual understanding which are not possible through other regression\nmethodologies.",

However, attaining\ntruly trustworthy AI concerns a wider vision that comprises the trustworthiness\nof all processes and actors that are part of the system's life cycle, and\nconsiders previous aspects from different lenses. A more holistic vision\ncontemplates four essential axes: the global principles for ethical use and\ndevelopment of AI-based systems, a philosophical take on AI ethics, a\nrisk-based approach to AI regulation, and the mentioned pillars and\nrequirements. The seven requirements (human agency and oversight; robustness\nand safety; privacy and data governance; transparency; diversity,\nnon-discrimination and fairness; societal and environmental wellbeing; and\naccountability) are analyzed from a triple perspective: What each requirement\nfor trustworthy AI is, Why it is needed, and How each requirement can be\nimplemented in practice. On the other hand, a practical approach to implement\ntrustworthy AI systems allows defining the concept of responsibility of\nAI-based systems facing the law, through a given auditing process. Therefore, a\nresponsible AI system is the resulting notion we introduce in this work, and a\nconcept of utmost necessity that can be realized through auditing processes,\nsubject to the challenges posed by the use of regulatory sandboxes. Our\nmultidisciplinary vision of trustworthy AI culminates in a debate on the\ndiverging views published lately about the future of AI. Our reflections in\nthis matter conclude that regulation is a key for reaching a consensus among\nthese views, and that trustworthy and responsible AI systems will be crucial\nfor the present and future of our society.",

We then\nanalyze the effect of personal information sharing and posts' topical, lexical,\nand sentiment markers on the acquisition of support and five interaction\nmeasures (submission scores, the number of comments, the number of unique\ncommenters, the length and sentiments of comments). Our findings show that: 1)\nusers were more likely to share their age, education, and location information\nwhen seeking both informational and emotional support, as opposed to pursuing\neither one; 2) while personal information sharing was positively correlated\nwith receiving informational support when requested, it did not correlate with\nemotional support; 3) as the degree of self-disclosure increased, information\nsupport seekers obtained higher submission scores and longer comments, whereas\nemotional support seekers' self-disclosure resulted in lower submission scores,\nfewer comments, and fewer unique commenters; 4) post characteristics affecting\nsocial feedback differed significantly based on types of support sought by post\nauthors. These results provide empirical evidence for the varying effects of\nself-disclosure on acquiring desired support and user involvement online during\nthe COVID-19 pandemic. Furthermore, this work can assist support seekers hoping\nto enhance and prioritize specific types of social feedback.",

    "abstract": "Social world knowledge is a key ingredient in effective communication and\ninformation processing by humans and machines alike. As of today, there exist\nmany knowledge bases that represent factual world knowledge. Yet, there is no\nresource that is designed to capture social aspects of world knowledge. We\nbelieve that this work makes an important step towards the formulation and\nconstruction of such a resource. We introduce SocialVec, a general framework\nfor eliciting low-dimensional entity embeddings from the social contexts in\nwhich they occur in social networks. In this framework, entities correspond to\nhighly popular accounts which invoke general interest. We assume that entities\nthat individual users tend to co-follow are socially related, and use this\ndefinition of social context to learn the entity embeddings. Similar to word\nembeddings which facilitate tasks that involve text semantics, we expect the\nlearned social entity embeddings to benefit multiple tasks of social flavor. In\nthis work, we elicited the social embeddings of roughly 200K entities from a\nsample of 1.3M Twitter users and the accounts that they follow. We employ and\ngauge the resulting embeddings on two tasks of social importance. First, we\nassess the political bias of news sources in terms of entity similarity in the\nsocial embedding space. Second, we predict the personal traits of individual\nTwitter users based on the social embeddings of entities that they follow. In\nboth cases, we show advantageous or competitive performance using our approach\ncompared with task-specific baselines. We further show that existing entity\nembedding schemes, which are fact-based, fail to capture social aspects of\nknowledge. We make the learned social entity embeddings available to the\nresearch community to support further exploration of social world knowledge and\nits applications.",

Strong social bonds are essential for health and wellbeing, but often\nhealth conditions can detrimentally affect a person's ability to interact with\nothers. This can become a vicious cycle resulting in further decline in health.\nFor this reason, the social management of health is an important aspect of\nhealthcare. We propose that socially assistive robots (SARs) could help people\nwith health conditions maintain positive social lives by supporting them in\nsocial interactions. This paper makes three contributions, as detailed below.\nWe develop a framework of social mediation functions that robots could perform,\nmotivated by the special social needs that people with health conditions have.\nIn this framework we identify five types of functions that SARs could perform:\na) changing how the person is perceived, b) enhancing the social behavior of\nthe person, c) modifying the social behavior of others, d) providing structure\nfor interactions, and e) changing how the person feels. We thematically\norganize and review the existing literature on robots supporting human-human\ninteractions, in both clinical and non-clinical settings, and explain how the\nfindings and design ideas from these studies can be applied to the functions\nidentified in the framework. Finally, we point out and discuss challenges in\ndesigning SARs for supporting social interactions, and highlight opportunities\nfor future robot design and HRI research on the mediator role of robots.",

In this article, we advance the theoretical debate on social networks\nas a source of social support by moving beyond the distinction between positive\nand negative ties.

We analyse the qualitative accounts of nineteen female\nvictims of domestic violence in Sweden, who described the responses of their\npersonal networks during and after the abuse. We observe how the relationships\nembedded in these networks were described in ambivalent and consistent terms,\nand how they played a role in supporting or undermining women in reframing\ntheir loving relationships as abusive; in accounting or dismissing perpetrators\nresponsibilities for the abuse; in relieving women from role expectations and\nobligations or in burdening them with further responsibilities; and in\nsupporting or challenging their pathways out of domestic abuse.

From the behavioral data in\nboth tasks, we found that learners were sensitive to the community structure of\nthe networks, as evidenced by a slower reaction time on trials transitioning\nbetween clusters than on trials transitioning within a cluster. From the\nneuroimaging data collected during the social network learning task, we\nobserved that the functional connectivity of the hippocampus and\ntemporoparietal junction was significantly greater when transitioning between\nclusters than when transitioning within a cluster. Furthermore, temporoparietal\nregions of the default mode were more strongly connected to hippocampus,\nsomatomotor, and visual regions during the social task than during the\nnon-social task. Collectively, our results identify neurophysiological\nunderpinnings of social versus non-social network learning, extending our\nknowledge about the impact of social context on learning processes.

    "abstract": "Social distancing as one of the main non-pharmaceutical interventions can\nhelp slow down the spread of diseases, like in the COVID-19 pandemic. Effective\nsocial distancing, unless enforced as drastic lockdowns and mandatory cordon\nsanitaire, requires consistent strict collective adherence. However, it remains\nunknown what the determinants for the resultant compliance of social distancing\nand their impact on disease mitigation are. Here, we incorporate into the\nepidemiological process with an evolutionary game theory model that governs the\nevolution of social distancing behavior. In our model, we assume an individual\nacts in their best interest and their decisions are driven by adaptive social\nlearning of the real-time risk of infection in comparison with the cost of\nsocial distancing. We find interesting oscillatory dynamics of social\ndistancing accompanied with waves of infection. Moreover, the oscillatory\ndynamics are dampened with a nontrivial dependence on model parameters\ngoverning decision-makings and gradually cease when the cumulative infections\nexceed the herd immunity. Compared to the scenario without social distancing,\nwe quantify the degree to which social distancing mitigates the epidemic and\nits dependence on individuals' responsiveness and rationality in their behavior\nchanges.

Design/methodology/approach: A\nthematic analysis of the most retweeted English-language tweets mentioning\nCOVID-19 during March 10-29, 2020. Findings: The main themes identified for the\n87 qualifying tweets accounting for 14 million retweets were: lockdown life;\nattitude towards social restrictions; politics; safety messages; people with\nCOVID-19; support for key workers; work; and COVID-19 facts/news. Research\nlimitations/implications: Twitter played many positive roles, mainly through\nunofficial tweets. Users shared social distancing information, helped build\nsupport for social distancing, criticised government responses, expressed\nsupport for key workers, and helped each other cope with social isolation. A\nfew popular tweets not supporting social distancing show that government\nmessages sometimes failed.

At the core of the challenge is that it is rarely what is stated\nexplicitly, but rather the implied meanings, that frame people's judgments\nabout others. For example, given a statement that \"we shouldn't lower our\nstandards to hire more women,\" most listeners will infer the implicature\nintended by the speaker -- that \"women (candidates) are less qualified.\" Most\nsemantic formalisms, to date, do not capture such pragmatic implications in\nwhich people express social biases and power differentials in language.\n  We introduce Social Bias Frames, a new conceptual formalism that aims to\nmodel the pragmatic frames in which people project social biases and\nstereotypes onto others. In addition, we introduce the Social Bias Inference\nCorpus to support large-scale modelling and evaluation with 150k structured\nannotations of social media posts, covering over 34k implications about a\nthousand demographic groups.\n  We then establish baseline approaches that learn to recover Social Bias\nFrames from unstructured text.

Three critical assumptions of this theory are that (1) the\ntransition of the ANS was associated with the evolution of social mammals from\nasocial reptiles; (2) the transition enabled mammals, unlike their reptilian\nancestors, to derive a biological benefit from social interactions; and (3) the\ntransition forces a less parsimonious explanation (convergence) for the\nevolution of social behavior in birds and mammals, since birds evolved from a\nreptilian lineage. Two recently published reviews, however, provided compelling\nevidence that the social asocial dichotomy is overly simplistic, neglects the\ndiversity of vertebrate social systems, impedes our understanding of the\nevolution of social behavior, and perpetuates the erroneous belief that one\ngroup, non-avian reptiles, is incapable of complex social behavior. In the\nworst case, if PT depends upon a transition from asocial reptiles to social\nmammals, then the ability of PT to explain the evolution of the mammalian ANS\nis highly questionable. A great number of social behaviors occur in both\nreptiles and mammals. In the best case, PT has misused the terms social and\nasocial. Even here, however, the theory would still need to identify a\nparticular suite of behaviors found in mammals and not reptiles that could be\nassociated with, or explain, the transition of the ANS, and then replace the\nasocial and social labels with more specific descriptors.",

Across millions of individuals, we find that multiple measures\nof social capital are concentrated among the rich and educated and among\nmigrants. Across destinations, both mobility patterns and social networks are\nconcentrated toward richer areas. A model of migration suggests individuals are\nindifferent between a 10% increase in destination wages and a 12-16% increase\nin destination social networks. Accounting for networks reduces the\nmigration-distance relationship by 19%. In equilibrium, equalizing social\nnetworks across locations improves average wages by 3% (24% for the bottom\nwage-quartile), a larger impact than removing the marginal cost of distance. We\nfind evidence of an economic support mechanism, with destination economic\nimprovements reducing the migration-network elasticity.

    "abstract": "Background An advantaged socioeconomic position (SEP) and satisfying social\nsupport during pregnancy (SSP) have been found to be protective factors of\nmaternal postpartum depression (PDD). An advantaged SEP is also associated with\nsatisfying SSP, making SSP a potential mediator of social inequalities in PPD.\nSEP, SSP and PPD are associated with migrant status. The aim of this study was\nto quantify the mediating role of SSP in social inequalities in PPD regarding\nmother's migrant status. Methods A sub-sample of 15,000 mothers from the French\nnationally-representative ELFE cohort study was used for the present analyses.\nSEP was constructed as a latent variable measured with educational attainment,\noccupational grade, employment, financial difficulties and household income.\nSSP was characterized as perceived support from partner (good relation,\nsatisfying support and paternal leave) and actual support from midwives\n(psychosocial risk factors assessment and antenatal education). Mediation\nanalyses with multiple mediators, stratified by migrant status were conducted.\nResults Study population included 76% of non-migrant women, 12% of second and\n12% of first generation migrant. SEP was positively associated with support\nfrom partner, regardless of migrant status. Satisfying partner support was\nassociated with a 8 (non-migrant women) to 11% (first generation migrant women)\nreduction in PPD score. Limitations History of depression was not\nreported.Conclusions Partner support could reduce social inequalities in PPD.\nThis work supports the need of interventions, longitudinal and qualitative\nstudies including fathers and adapted to women at risk of PPD to better\nunderstand the role of SSP in social inequalities in PPD.

In human-human dyads, social\nbonding plays a powerful role in regulating behaviours, emotions, and even\nhealth. If this is to extend to human-robot dyads, the phenomenology of such\nrelationships (including their emergence and stability) must be better\nunderstood. In this paper, we discuss potential approaches towards\noperationalizing the phenomenon of social bonding between human-robot dyads. We\nwill discuss a number of biobehavioural proxies of social bonding, moving away\nfrom existing approaches that use subjective, psychological measures, and\ninstead grounding our approach in some of the evolutionary, neurobiological and\nphysiological correlates of social bond formation in natural systems: (a)\nreductions in physiological stress (the ''social buffering'' phenomenon), (b)\nnarrowing of spatial proximity between dyads, and (c) inter-dyad behavioural\nsynchrony. We provide relevant evolutionary support for each proposed\ncomponent, with suggestions and considerations for how they can be recorded in\n(real-time) human-robot interaction scenarios. With this, we aim to inspire\nmore robust operationalisation of ''social bonding'' between human and\nartificial (robotic) agents.",

    "abstract": "This thesis develops a conceptual framework considering social data as\nrepresenting the surface layer of a hierarchy of human social behaviours, needs\nand cognition which is employed to transform social data into representations\nthat preserve social behaviours and their causalities. Based on this framework\ntwo platforms were built to capture insights from fast-paced and slow-paced\nsocial data. For fast-paced, a self-structuring and incremental learning\ntechnique was developed to automatically capture salient topics and\ncorresponding dynamics over time. An event detection technique was developed to\nautomatically monitor those identified topic pathways for significant\nfluctuations in social behaviours using multiple indicators such as volume and\nsentiment. This platform is demonstrated using two large datasets with over 1\nmillion tweets. The separated topic pathways were representative of the key\ntopics of each entity and coherent against topic coherence measures. Identified\nevents were validated against contemporary events reported in news. Secondly\nfor the slow-paced social data, a suite of new machine learning and natural\nlanguage processing techniques were developed to automatically capture\nself-disclosed information of the individuals such as demographics, emotions\nand timeline of personal events. This platform was trialled on a large text\ncorpus of over 4 million posts collected from online support groups. This was\nfurther extended to transform prostate cancer related online support group\ndiscussions into a multidimensional representation and investigated the\nself-disclosed quality of life of patients (and partners) against time,\ndemographics and clinical factors.

Unfortunately, many of them are too subjective to be\nmeasured and presented in online social networks. On the other hand, data\nmining techniques can better find data patterns but many of them leave behind\nunnatural understanding. In this paper, we propose a fundamental methodology to\nsupport the further fusion of data mining techniques and sociological\nbehavioral criteria. Our highlights are three-fold: First, we propose an\neffective hypergraph awareness and a fast line graph construction framework.\nThe hypergraph can more profoundly indicate the interactions between\nindividuals and their environments because each edge in the hypergraph (a.k.a\nhyperedge) contains more than two nodes, which is perfect to describe social\nenvironments. A line graph treats each social environment as a super node with\nthe underlying influence between different environments. In this way, we go\nbeyond traditional pair-wise relations and explore richer patterns under\nvarious sociological criteria; Second, we propose a novel hypergraph-based\nneural network to learn social influence flowing from users to users, users to\nenvironments, environment to users, and environments to environments. The\nneural network can be learned via a task-free method, making our model very\nflexible to support various data mining tasks and sociological analysis; Third,\nwe propose both qualitative and quantitive solutions to effectively evaluate\nthe most common sociological criteria like social conformity, social\nequivalence, environmental evolving and social polarization. Our extensive\nexperiments show that our framework can better support both data mining tasks\nfor online user behaviours and sociological analysis.",

    "abstract": "New Mobile technologies have created a new social dimension where individuals\ncan develop increased levels of their social awareness by keeping in touch with\nold friends, making new friends, dispense new data or product, and getting\ninformation in many more aspects of everyday lives, making one to become more\nknowledgeable which is very beneficial especially for students. Social\nnetworks, in particular enable users to share and discuss common interests and\nprovide infrastructures for integrating various user experiences: synchronous\nand asynchronous communication, game-playing, sharing links and files. The\ntrend of using social networks and social media to deliver and exchange\nknowledge could bring a new era of social learning in which learners make use\nall four language skills of reading, writing, listening and speaking. Unlike a\ntraditional e-leaning paradigm with pre-defined curriculum and standard\ntextbooks, social knowledge could be aggregated on demand, just in time, and in\ncontext of engaging challenges from social networks, making learning more\nexciting, social and, game-like experience. Social learning environment engages\nthe learners in discussion, collaboration, exploration, production, discovery\nand creation. Schools should harness this to develop group collaboration skills\nand even project based learning activities that span subjects and grade levels.\nThis paper focuses on technologies and avenues of using mobile phones in\nsupporting open social learning among undergraduate students in Nigeria.",

Our research aims to breach this gap in computational social science\nby proposing an unsupervised, parameter-free method to discover, with high\naccuracy, the fundamental domains of interaction occurring in social networks.\nBy applying this method on two online datasets different by scope and type of\ninteraction (aNobii and Flickr) we observe the spontaneous emergence of three\ndomains of interaction representing the exchange of status, knowledge and\nsocial support. By finding significant relations between the domains of\ninteraction and classic social network analysis issues (e.g., tie strength,\ndyadic interaction over time) we show how the network of interactions induced\nby the extracted domains can be used as a starting point for more nuanced\nanalysis of online social data that may one day incorporate the normative\ngrammar of social interaction.

However, little is known about how the\ninformation propagation in Twitter is constrained by its inner structure. In\nthis paper, we present an in-depth study of the macroscopic structure of the\nTwitter social graph unveiling the highways on which tweets propagate, the\nspecific user activity associated with each component of this macroscopic\nstructure, and the evolution of this macroscopic structure with time for the\npast 6 years. For this study, we crawled Twitter to retrieve all accounts and\nall social relationships (follow links) among accounts; the crawl completed in\nJuly 2012 with 505 million accounts interconnected by 23 billion links. Then,\nwe present a methodology to unveil the macroscopic structure of the Twitter\nsocial graph. This macroscopic structure consists of 8 components defined by\ntheir connectivity characteristics.

    "abstract": "It is a recurring problem of online communication that the properties of\nunknown people are hard to assess. This may lead to various issues such as the\nspread of `fake news' from untrustworthy sources. In sociology the sum of\n(social) resources available to a person through their social network is often\ndescribed as social capital. In this article, we look at social capital from a\ndifferent angle. Instead of evaluating the advantage that people have because\nof their membership in a certain group, we investigate various ways to infer\nthe social capital a person adds or may add to the network, their contributive\nsocial capital (CSC). As there is no consensus in the literature on what the\nsocial capital of a person exactly consists of, we look at various related\nproperties: expertise, reputation, trustworthiness, and influence. The analysis\nof these features is investigated for five different sources of online data:\nmicroblogging (e.g., Twitter), social networking platforms (e.g., Facebook),\ndirect communication (e.g., email), scientometrics, and threaded discussion\nboards (e.g., Reddit). In each field we discuss recent publications and put a\nfocus on the data sources used, the algorithms implemented, and the performance\nevaluation. The findings are compared and set in context to contributive social\ncapital extraction. The analysis algorithms are based on individual features\n(e.g., followers on Twitter), ratios thereof, or a person's centrality measures\n(e.g., PageRank). The machine learning approaches, such as straightforward\nclassifiers (e.g., support vector machines) use ground truths that are\nconnected to social capital. The discussion of these methods is intended to\nfacilitate research on the topic by identifying relevant data sources and the\nbest suited algorithms, and by providing tested methods for the evaluation of\nfindings.",

    "abstract": "Purpose: Data discovery practices currently tend to be studied from the\nperspective of researchers or the perspective of support specialists. This\nseparation is problematic, as it becomes easy for support specialists to build\ninfrastructures and services based on perceptions of researchers' practices,\nrather than the practices themselves. This paper brings together and analyzes\nboth perspectives to support the building of effective infrastructures and\nservices for data discovery. Methods: This is a meta-synthesis of work the\nauthors have conducted over the last six years investigating the data discovery\npractices of researchers from different disciplines, with a focus on the social\nsciences, and support specialists. We bring together and re-analyze data\ncollected from in-depth interview studies with 6 support specialists in the\nfield of social science in Germany, with 21 social scientists in Singapore, an\ninterview with 10 researchers and 3 support specialists from multiple\ndisciplines, a global survey with 1630 researchers and 47 support specialists\nfrom multiple disciplines, an observational study with 12 researchers from the\nfield of social science and a use case analysis of 25 support specialists from\nmultiple disciplines. Results: We found that there are many similarities in\nwhat researchers and support specialists want and think about data discovery,\nboth in social sciences and in other disciplines. There are, however, some\ndifferences which we have identified, most notably the interconnection of data\ndiscovery with web search, literature search and social networks. Conclusion:\nWe conclude by proposing recommendations for how different types of support\nwork can address these points of difference to better support researchers' data\ndiscovery practices.",

    "abstract": "Social media is both helpful and harmful to the work against sex trafficking.\nOn one hand, social workers carefully use social media to support people\nexperiencing sex trafficking. On the other hand, traffickers use social media\nto groom and recruit people into trafficking situations. There is the\nopportunity to use social media data to better provide support for people\nexperiencing trafficking.\n  While AI and Machine Learning (ML) have been used in work against sex\ntrafficking, they predominantly focus on detecting Child Sexual Abuse Material.\nWork using social media data has not been done with the intention to provide\ncommunity level support to people of all ages experiencing trafficking. Within\nthis context, this thesis explores the use of semi-supervised classification to\nidentify social media posts that are a part of the sex industry.\n  Several methods were explored for ML. However, the primary method used was\nsemi-supervised learning, which has the benefit of providing automated\nclassification with a limited set of labelled data. Social media posts were\nembedded into low-dimensional vectors using FastText and Doc2Vec models. The\ndata were then clustered using k-means clustering, and cross-validation was\nused to determine label propagation accuracy.\n  The results of the semi-supervised algorithm were encouraging. The FastText\nCBOW model provided 98.6% accuracy to over 12,000 posts in clusters where label\npropagation was applied. The results of this thesis suggest that further\nsemi-supervised learning, in conjunction with manual labeling, may allow for\nthe entire dataset containing over 50,000 posts to be accurately labeled.\n  A fully labeled dataset could be used to develop a tool to identify an\noverview of where and when social media is used within the sex industry. This\ncould be used to help determine better ways to provide support to people\nexperiencing trafficking.",

We compare residents from below-median income\nneighborhoods with above-median income neighborhoods, and find that users\nliving in relatively poorer neighborhoods have a significantly higher share of\nconnections in close proximity. Moreover, their network is more cohesive and\nsupported within a short distance from their home. These patterns prevail\nacross the 50 largest US metropolitan areas with only a few exceptions.

Negative effects of social\nspammers do not only annoy users, but also lead to financial loss and privacy\nissues. There are two main challenges of spammer detection on Twitter. Firstly,\nthe data of social network scale with a huge volume of streaming social data.\nSecondly, spammers continually change their spamming strategy such as changing\ncontent patterns or trying to gain social influence, disguise themselves as far\nas possible. With those challenges, it is hard to directly apply traditional\nbatch learning methods to quickly adapt newly spamming pattern in the\nhigh-volume and real-time social media data. We need an anti-spammer system to\nbe able to adjust the learning model when getting a label feedback. Moreover,\nthe data on social media may be unbounded. Then, the system must allow update\nefficiency model in both computation and memory requirements. Online learning\nis an ideal solution for this problem.

    "abstract": "Granovetter's weak tie theory of social networks is built around two central\nhypotheses. The first states that strong social ties carry the large majority\nof interaction events; the second maintains that weak social ties, although\nless active, are often relevant for the exchange of especially important\ninformation (e.g., about potential new jobs in Granovetter's work). While\nseveral empirical studies have provided support for the first hypothesis, the\nsecond has been the object of far less scrutiny. A possible reason is that it\ninvolves notions relative to the nature and importance of the information that\nare hard to quantify and measure, especially in large scale studies. Here, we\nsearch for empirical validation of both Granovetter's hypotheses. We find clear\nempirical support for the first. We also provide empirical evidence and a\nquantitative interpretation for the second. We show that attention, measured as\nthe fraction of interactions devoted to a particular social connection, is high\non weak ties --- possibly reflecting the postulated informational purposes of\nsuch ties --- but also on very strong ties. Data from online social media and\nmobile communication reveal network-dependent mixtures of these two effects on\nthe basis of a platform's typical usage. Our results establish a clear\nrelationships between attention, importance, and strength of social links, and\ncould lead to improved algorithms to prioritize social media content.",

The broadcasting region creates a\ndigital aura and is limited by WiFi region that is around 200 meters.

The peer-to-peer group can be used for\nprivate communication when the network is not available.",

Before that, we need to know clearly what is SCK and how to\nrepresent it, since automatic information processing requires data and\nknowledge are organized in structured and semantically related ways. For this\nreason, in this paper, we identify and formalize three basic types of SCK based\non first-order theory. Firstly, we identify and formalize the\ninterrelationships, such as having-role and having-social_relation, among\nsocial contexts, roles and players from the perspective of considering both\ncontexts and roles as first-order citizens and not generating role instances.\nSecondly, we provide a four level structure to identify and formalize the\nintrinsic information, such as events and desires, of social contexts, roles\nand players, and illustrate the way of harvesting the intrinsic information of\nsocial contexts and roles from the exhibition of players in concrete contexts.\nAnd thirdly, enlightened by some observations of actual contexts, we further\nintroduce and formalize the embedding of social contexts, and depict the way of\nexcavating the intrinsic information of social contexts and roles from the\nembedded smaller and simpler contexts. The results of this paper lay the\nfoundation not only for formalizing much more complex SCK but also for\nacquiring these three basic types of SCK.",

Consequently, today's\nmobile networks are becoming increasingly human centric. This leads to the\nemergence of a new field which we call socially-aware networking (SAN). One of\nthe major features of SAN is that social awareness becomes indispensable\ninformation for the design of networking solutions. This emerging paradigm is\napplicable to various types of networks (e.g. opportunistic networks, mobile\nsocial networks, delay tolerant networks, ad hoc networks, etc) where the users\nhave social relationships and interactions. By exploiting social properties of\nnodes, SAN can provide better networking support to innovative applications and\nservices. In addition, it facilitates the convergence of human society and\ncyber physical systems. In this paper, for the first time, to the best of our\nknowledge, we present a survey of this emerging field. Basic concepts of SAN\nare introduced. We intend to generalize the widely-used social properties in\nthis regard.

    "abstract": "Social media have become a valuable source for extracting data about societal\ncrises and an important outlet to disseminate official information. Government\nagencies are increasingly turning to social media to use it as a mouthpiece in\ntimes of crisis. Gaining intelligence through social media analytics, however,\nremains a challenge for government agencies, e.g. due to a lack of training and\ninstruments. To mitigate this shortcoming, government agencies need tools that\nsupport them in analysing social media data for the public good. This paper\npresents a design science research approach that guides the development of a\nsocial media analytics dashboard for a regional government agency. Preliminary\nresults from a workshop and the resulting design of a first prototype are\nreported. A user-friendly and responsive design that is secure, flexible, and\nquick in use could identified as requirements, as well as information display\nof regional discussion statistics, sentiment, and emerging topics.",

Therefore, the enterprises, which plan to act on\nterms of social and ethical marketing, should monitor the social responsibility\nof consumers in the relevant markets. At the same time, special attention\nshould be paid to the analysis of factors that prevent consumers from\nimplementing their socially responsible intentions in the regions with a low\nlevel of social activity of consumers. The purpose of the article is to develop\nmethodological guidelines that determine the tasks and directions of conducting\nempirical studies aimed at assessing the gap between the socially responsible\nintentions of consumers and the actual implementation of these intentions, as\nwell as to identify the causes of this gap. An empirical survey of the sampled\nconsumers in Kharkiv was carried out in terms of the proposed methodological\nprovisions. It revealed a rather high level of respondents' willingness to\nsupport socially responsible enterprises and a rather low level of\nimplementation of these intentions due to the lack of consumers awareness. To\ntest the proposed methodological guidelines, an empirical study of the\nconsumers social responsibility was conducted in 2017 on a sample of students\nand professors of the Semen Kuznets Kharkiv National University of Economics\n(120 people). Questioning of the respondents was carried out using the Google\nForms.

Social isolation is closely\nassociated with situational loneliness (i.e., loneliness emerging from\nenvironmental change), a risk factor for depressive symptoms. Prior research\nsuggested vulnerable young adults are likely to seek support from an online\nsocial platform such as Reddit, a perceived comfortable environment for lonely\nindividuals to seek mental health help through anonymous communication with a\nbroad social network. Therefore, this study aims to identify and analyze\ndepression-related dialogues on loneliness subreddits during the COVID-19\noutbreak, with the implications on depression-related infoveillance during the\npandemic. Our study utilized logistic regression and topic modeling to classify\nand examine depression-related discussions on loneliness subreddits before and\nduring the pandemic. Our results showed significant increases in the volume of\ndepression-related discussions (i.e., topics related to mental health, social\ninteraction, family, and emotion) where challenges were reported during the\npandemic. We also found a switch in dominant topics emerging from\ndepression-related discussions on loneliness subreddits, from dating\n(prepandemic) to online interaction and community (pandemic), suggesting the\nincreased expressions or need of online social support during the pandemic. The\ncurrent findings suggest the potential of social media to serve as a window for\nmonitoring public mental health. Our future study will clinically validate the\ncurrent approach, which has implications for designing a surveillance system\nduring the crisis.",

This works well for large scale strong-signal\nevents such as hurricanes, and important classes of events such as earthquakes.\nHowever, for a variety of domains there is insufficient sensor coverage, e.g.,\nlandslides, wildfires, and flooding. Social networks have provided massive\nvolume of data from billions of users, but data from these generic social\nsensors contain much more noise than physical sensors. One of the most\ndifficult challenges presented by social sensors is \\textit{concept drift},\nwhere the terms associated with a phenomenon evolve and change over time,\nrendering static machine learning (ML) classifiers less effective. To address\nthis problem, we develop the ASSED (Adaptive Social Sensor Event Detection)\nframework with an ML-based event processing engine and show how it can perform\nsimple and complex physical event detection on strong- \\textit{and} weak-signal\nwith low-latency, high scalability, and accurate coverage. Specifically, ASSED\nis a framework to support continuous filter generation and updates with machine\nlearning using streaming data from high-confidence sources (physical and\nannotated sensors) and social networks. We build ASSED to support procedures\nfor integrating high-confidence sources into social sensor event detection to\ngenerate high-quality filters and to perform dynamic filter selection by\ntracking its own performance. We demonstrate ASSED capabilities through a\nlandslide detection application that detects almost 350\\% more landslides\ncompared to static approaches.

We\nstudied the effects of ascribed traits (gender, age) and acquired traits\n(geography, and information source) on the speed of mobilization.

Homophily was present for\nacquired traits, in which mobilization speed was faster when the recuiter and\nrecruit had the same trait compared to different traits. In contrast, we did\nnot find support for homophily for the ascribed traits. Instead, those traits\nhad other, non-homophily effects: Females mobilized other females faster than\nmales mobilized other males. Younger recruiters mobilized others faster, and\nolder recruits mobilized slower. Recruits also mobilized faster when they first\nheard about the contest directly from the contest organization, and decreased\nin speed when hearing from less personal source types (e.g. family vs. media).\nThese findings show that social mobilization includes dynamics that are unlike\nother, more passive forms of social activity propagation.

For over 100 years,\nscholars of social contagion have almost exclusively made the same implicit\nassumption: that only one belief, idea, or practice spreads through the\npopulation at a time. It is a default assumption that we don't bother to state,\nlet alone justify. The assumption is so ingrained that our literature doesn't\neven have a word for \"whatever is to be diffused\", because we have never needed\nto discuss more than one of them. But this assumption is obviously false.\nMillions of beliefs, ideas, and practices (let's call them \"diffusants\") spread\nthrough social contagion every day. To assume that diffusants spread one at a\ntime - or more generously, that they spread independently of one another - is\nto assume that interactions between diffusants have no influence on adoption\npatterns. This could be true, or it could be wildly off the mark. We've never\nstopped to find out. This paper makes a direct comparison between the spread of\nindependent and interdependent beliefs using simulations, observational data,\nand a 2400-subject laboratory experiment. I find that in assuming independence\nbetween diffusants, scholars have overlooked social processes that\nfundamentally change the outcomes of social contagion. Interdependence between\nbeliefs generates polarization, irrespective of social network structure,\nhomophily, demographics, politics, or any other commonly cited cause. It also\ncoordinates structures of beliefs that can have both internal justification and\nsocial support without any grounding in external truth.",

    "abstract": "The social media platform \"Parler\" has emerged into a prominent fringe\ncommunity where a significant part of the user base are self-reported\nsupporters of QAnon, a far-right conspiracy theory alleging that a cabal of\nelites controls global politics. QAnon is considered to have had an influential\nrole in the public discourse during the 2020 U.S. presidential election.\nHowever, little is known about QAnon supporters on Parler and what sets them\naside from other users. Building up on social identity theory, we aim at\nprofiling the characteristics of QAnon supporters on Parler. We analyze a\nlarge-scale dataset with more than 600,000 profiles of English-speaking users\non Parler. Based on users' profiles, posts, and comments, we then extract a\ncomprehensive set of user features, linguistic features, network features, and\ncontent features. This allows us to perform user profiling and understand to\nwhat extent these features discriminate between QAnon and non-QAnon supporters\non Parler. Our analysis is three-fold: (1) We quantify the number of QAnon\nsupporters on Parler, finding that 34,913 users (5.5% of all users) openly\nreport to support the conspiracy. (2) We examine differences between QAnon vs.\nnon-QAnon supporters. We find that QAnon supporters differ statistically\nsignificantly from non-QAnon supporters across multiple dimensions. For\nexample, they have, on average, a larger number of followers, followees, and\nposts, and thus have a large impact on the Parler network. (3) We use machine\nlearning to identify which user characteristics discriminate QAnon from\nnon-QAnon supporters. We find that user features, linguistic features, network\nfeatures, and content features, can - to a large extent - discriminate QAnon\nvs. non-QAnon supporters on Parler. In particular, we find that user features\nare highly discriminatory, followed by content features and linguistic\nfeatures.",

    "abstract": "Online social media and games are increasingly replacing offline social\nactivities. Social media is now an indispensable mode of communication; online\ngaming is not only a genuine social activity but also a popular spectator\nsport. With support for anonymity and larger audiences, online interaction\nshrinks social and geographical barriers. Despite such benefits, social\ndisparities such as gender inequality persist in online social media. In\nparticular, online gaming communities have been criticized for persistent\ngender disparities and objectification. As gaming evolves into a social\nplatform, persistence of gender disparity is a pressing question. Yet, there\nare few large-scale, systematic studies of gender inequality and\nobjectification in social gaming platforms. Here we analyze more than one\nbillion chat messages from Twitch, a social game-streaming platform, to study\nhow the gender of streamers is associated with the nature of conversation.\nUsing a combination of computational text analysis methods, we show that\ngendered conversation and objectification is prevalent in chats. Female\nstreamers receive significantly more objectifying comments while male streamers\nreceive more game-related comments. This difference is more pronounced for\npopular streamers. There also exists a large number of users who post only on\nfemale or male streams. Employing a neural vector-space embedding (paragraph\nvector) method, we analyze gendered chat messages and create prediction models\nthat (i) identify the gender of streamers based on messages posted in the\nchannel and (ii) identify the gender a viewer prefers to watch based on their\nchat messages. Our findings suggest that disparities in social game-streaming\nplatforms is a nuanced phenomenon that involves the gender of streamers as well\nas those who produce gendered and game-related conversation.",

The hybrid underlying network is composed of large numbers of\nmobile users and a small portion of Access Points (APs). Because APs can\nfacilitate the communication among long-distance nodes, the concept of physical\nproximity community can be extended to be one across the geographical space. In\nthis work, we first investigate a space-crossing community detection method for\nMSNs. Based on the detection results, we design a novel data forwarding\nalgorithm SAAS (Social Attraction and AP Spreading), and show how to exploit\nthe space-crossing communities to improve the data forwarding efficiency. We\nevaluate our SAAS algorithm on real-life data from MIT Reality Mining and UIM.\nResults show that space-crossing community plays a positive role in data\nforwarding in MSNs in terms of deliver ratio and delay.

    "abstract": "This paper extends and validates a model of value-driven online healthcare\ninformation search in online shared contexts. Perceived value is an important\nfactor behind users' decisions concerning search, consumption and reuse of\nproducts and services. The role of utilitarian, hedonic and epistemic value of\ninformation in user satisfaction and intention to repeat online search is well\nrecognized, but little support has been found for social value affecting user\nsatisfaction critical for such decisions. Therefore, a value-based model of\nonline healthcare information search was extended adding detailed information\nquality measures. Our survey data collected from 143 college going students\nfrom more than 10 countries studying in South Korea demonstrated two novel\nresults. At first, unlike existing studies, strong support was found for\nperceived social value affecting the user satisfaction. As a second substantial\nfinding, the significance of social value could only be appreciated by using\ncomprehensive constructs of information quality than simpler measures.\nTherefore, this study shows for social and shared HIS, users consider access,\nrepresentation and context quality of healthcare information to be more\nimportant from social perspective than intrinsic (or content) quality.\nTherefore, developers and healthcare organizations interested in traction of\ntheir online healthcare information delivery systems (HIS), especially those\nusing internet and social media networks, should focus on enhancing information\nquality of their systems accordingly.",

    "abstract": "It is well understood that the structure of a social network is critical to\nwhether or not agents can aggregate information correctly. In this paper, we\nstudy social networks that support information aggregation when rational agents\nact sequentially and irrevocably. Whether or not information is aggregated\ndepends, inter alia, on the order in which agents decide. Thus, to decouple the\norder and the topology, our model studies a random arrival order.\n  Unlike the case of a fixed arrival order, in our model, the decision of an\nagent is unlikely to be affected by those who are far from him in the network.\nThis observation allows us to identify a local learning requirement, a natural\ncondition on the agent's neighborhood that guarantees that this agent makes the\ncorrect decision (with high probability) no matter how well other agents\nperform. Roughly speaking, the agent should belong to a multitude of mutually\nexclusive social circles.\n  We illustrate the power of the local learning requirement by constructing a\nfamily of social networks that guarantee information aggregation despite that\nno agent is a social hub (in other words, there are no opinion leaders).\nAlthough the common wisdom of the social learning literature suggests that\ninformation aggregation is very fragile, another application of the local\nlearning requirement demonstrates the existence of networks where learning\nprevails even if a substantial fraction of the agents are not involved in the\nlearning process. On a technical level, the networks we construct rely on the\ntheory of expander graphs, i.e., highly connected sparse graphs with a wide\nrange of applications from pure mathematics to error-correcting codes.",

To date, however, the correspondence between tie\nstrength and population's economic prospects has not been quantified, largely\nbecause of the inability to operationalise strength based on Granovetter's\nclassic theory. Our work departed from the premise that tie strength is a\nunidimensional construct (typically operationalized with frequency or volume of\ncontact), and used instead a validated model of ten fundamental dimensions of\nsocial relationships grounded in the literature of social psychology. We built\nstate-of-the-art NLP tools to infer the presence of these dimensions from\ntextual communication, and analyzed a large conversation network of 630K\ngeo-referenced Reddit users across the entire US connected by 12.8M social ties\ncreated over the span of 7 years. We found that unidimensional tie strength is\nonly weakly correlated with economic opportunities (R2=0.30), while\nmultidimensional constructs are highly correlated (R2=0.62). In particular,\neconomic opportunities are associated to the combination of: i) knowledge ties,\nwhich bridge geographically distant groups, facilitating the knowledge\ndissemination across communities; and ii) social support ties, which knit\ngeographically close communities together, and represent dependable sources of\nsocial and emotional support. These results point to the importance of\ndeveloping high-quality measures of tie strength in network theory.",

We focus on the challenge that the Non-HMD user is not able to\ninterpret the HMD user's state -- e.g., attentiveness; the need for assistance\n--, as the HMD covers the wearer's face. We propose a front facing display\nattached to the HMD that supports collaboration by showing the state. We\nexplore the impact of abstract and realistic visualizations for such displays\non collaborative performance and social presence in a within-subject user study\n(N=25). We present to the Non-HMD user (1) a blank screen (baseline), (2)\ntextual representation of the user's state and (3) a representation that looks\nlike the HMD is see-through. The results show positive effects for textual\nrepresentation on collaborative performance and a positive effect of realistic\nrepresentation on social presence. We conclude that when developing HMDs we\nneed to take into account the social needs of everyday life to reduce the risk\nof social separation in a household context.",

    "abstract": "Carbon abatement decisions are usually based on the implausible assumption of\nconstant social preference. This paper focuses on a specific case of market and\nnon-market goods, and investigates the optimal climate policy when social\npreference for them is also changed by climate policy in the DICE model. The\nrelative price of non-market goods grows over time due to increases in both\nrelative scarcity and appreciation of it. Therefore, climbing relative price\nbrings upward the social cost of carbon denominated in terms of market goods.\nBecause abatement decision affects the valuation of non-market goods in the\nutility function, unlike previous climate-economy models, we solve the model\niteratively by taking the obtained abatement rates from the last run as inputs\nin the current run. The results in baseline calibration advocate a more\nstringent climate policy, where endogenous social preference to climate policy\nraises the social cost of carbon further by roughly 12%-18% this century.\nMoreover, neglecting changing social preference leads to an underestimate of\nnon-market goods damages by 15%. Our results support that climate policy is\nself-reinforced if it favors more expensive consumption type.",

Therefore, they may change their opinions\nover time, which may mean supporting one particular candidate or none.\nCandidates attempt to gain people's support by interacting with them, whether\nthey are in the same social circle (i.e. neighbors) or not. In particular,\ncandidates follow a strategy of interacting for a time with people they do not\nknow (that is, people who are not their neighbors). Our analysis of the\nproposed model sought to establish which network strategies are the most\neffective for candidates to gain popular support. We found that the most\nsuitable strategy depends on the topology of the social network. Finally, we\ninvestigated the role of charisma in these dynamics. Charisma is relevant in\nseveral social contexts, since charismatic people usually exercise a strong\ninfluence over others. Our results showed that candidates' charisma is an\nimportant contributory factor to a successful network strategy in election\ncampaigns.",

Recent studies illustrate that incorporating social trust\nin Matrix Factorization methods demonstrably improves accuracy of rating\nprediction. Such approaches mainly use the trust scores explicitly expressed by\nusers. However, it is often challenging to have users provide explicit trust\nscores of each other. There exist quite a few works, which propose Trust\nMetrics to compute and predict trust scores between users based on their\ninteractions. In this paper, first we present how social relation can be\nextracted from users' ratings to items by describing Hellinger distance between\nusers in recommender systems. Then, we propose to incorporate the predicted\ntrust scores into social matrix factorization models. By analyzing social\nrelation extraction from three well-known real-world datasets, which both:\ntrust and recommendation data available, we conclude that using the implicit\nsocial relation in social recommendation techniques has almost the same\nperformance compared to the actual trust scores explicitly expressed by users.\nHence, we build our method, called Hell-TrustSVD, on top of the\nstate-of-the-art social recommendation technique to incorporate both the\nextracted implicit social relations and ratings given by users on the\nprediction of items for an active user. To the best of our knowledge, this is\nthe first work to extend TrustSVD with extracted social trust information. The\nexperimental results support the idea of employing implicit trust into matrix\nfactorization whenever explicit trust is not available, can perform much better\nthan the state-of-the-art approaches in user rating prediction.",

The paper confronts this question here\nby showing vital determinants of science to explain the sources of social power\nand wealth creation by nations. Firstly, this study suggests a new general\ndefinition of science and scientific research that synthetizes previous\nconcepts and endeavors to extend them: Science discovers the root causes of\nphenomena to explain and predict them in a context of adaptation of life to new\neconomic and social bases, whereas scientific research is a systematic process,\napplying methods of scientific inquiry, to solve consequential problems, to\nsatisfy human wants, to take advantage of important opportunities and/or to\ncope with environmental threats. In particular, science and scientific research\nare driven by an organized social effort that inevitably reflect the concerns\nand interests of nations to achieve advances and discoveries that are spread to\nthe rest of humankind. This study reveals that scientific research is produced\nfor social and economic interests of nations (power, wealth creation,\ntechnological superiority, etc.), rather than philosophical inquiries. A main\nimplication of this study is that the immense growth of science in modern\nsociety is not only due to activity of scientists but rather to general social\nefforts of nations to take advantage of important opportunities and/or to cope\nwith environmental threats, such as war. Empirical evidence endeavors to\nsupport the sources of scientific research for nations, described here.\nFinally, relationships between R&D investment and productivity, and research\npolicy implications are discussed.",

Deliberately exposing selected agents to random\ninformation is a technique already experimented in recommender systems or\nsearch engines, and represents one of the few options for influencing the\nbehavior of a social context that could be accepted as ethical, could be fully\ndisclosed to members, and does not involve the use of force or of deception.\nOur research is based on a model of knowledge diffusion applied to a\ntime-varying adaptive network, and considers two well-known strategies for\ninfluencing social contexts. One is the selection of few influencers for\nmanipulating their actions in order to drive the whole network to a certain\nbehavior; the other, instead, drives the network behavior acting on the state\nof a large subset of ordinary, scarcely influencing users. The two approaches\nhave been studied in terms of network and diffusion effects. The network effect\nis analyzed through the changes induced on network average degree and\nclustering coefficient, while the diffusion effect is based on two ad-hoc\nmetrics defined to measure the degree of knowledge diffusion and skill level,\nas well as the polarization of agent interests. The results, obtained through\nsimulations on synthetic networks, show a rich dynamics and strong effects on\nthe communication structure and on the distribution of knowledge and skills,\nsupporting our hypothesis that the strategic use of random information could\nrepresent a realistic approach to social network controllability, and that with\nboth strategies, in principle, the control effect could be remarkable.",

Typically,\nrelationships are represented simply as links, perhaps with weights. The lack\nof finer granularity is due in part to the fact that, aside from linkage and\nstrength, no fundamental or immediately obvious dimensions exist along which to\ncategorize relationships. Here we propose a set of dimensions that capture\nmajor components of many relationships -- derived both from relevant academic\nliterature and people's everyday descriptions of their relationships. We first\nreview prominent findings in sociology and social psychology, highlighting\ndimensions that have been widely used to categorize social relationships. Next,\nwe examine the validity of these dimensions empirically in two crowd-sourced\nexperiments. Ultimately, we arrive at a set of ten major dimensions that can be\nused to categorize relationships: similarity, trust, romance, social support,\nidentity, respect, knowledge exchange, power, fun, and conflict. These ten\ndimensions, while not dispositive, offer higher resolution than existing\nmodels. Indeed, we show that one can more accurately predict missing links in a\nsocial graph by using these dimensions than by using a state-of-the-art link\nembeddedness method.

The recommender model achieves an accuracy of 98% by employing a\ncombination of global vectors for word representation (GloVe) and LSTM models.\nTo provide a more immersive and empathetic user experience, a text-to-speech\nmodel called GlowTTS is integrated, enabling the therapy chatbot to audibly\ncommunicate the generated recommendations to users in both English and Persian.\nThe proposed approach offers promising potential to enhance therapy chatbots by\nproviding them with the ability to recognize and respond to users' emotions,\nultimately improving the delivery of mental health support for both English and\nPersian-speaking users.",

    "abstract": "In the wake of the post-pandemic era, marked by social isolation and surging\nrates of depression and anxiety, conversational agents based on digital\npsychotherapy can play an influential role compared to traditional therapy\nsessions. In this work, we develop a voice-capable chatbot in Farsi to guide\nusers through Self-Attachment (SAT), a novel, self-administered, holistic\npsychological technique based on attachment theory. Our chatbot uses a dynamic\narray of rule-based and classification-based modules to comprehend user input\nthroughout the conversation and navigates a dialogue flowchart accordingly,\nrecommending appropriate SAT exercises that depend on the user's emotional and\nmental state. In particular, we collect a dataset of over 6,000 utterances and\ndevelop a novel sentiment-analysis module that classifies user sentiment into\n12 classes, with accuracy above 92%. To keep the conversation novel and\nengaging, the chatbot's responses are retrieved from a large dataset of\nutterances created with the aid of Farsi GPT-2 and a reinforcement learning\napproach, thus requiring minimal human annotation. Our chatbot also offers a\nquestion-answering module, called SAT Teacher, to answer users' questions about\nthe principles of Self-Attachment. Finally, we design a cross-platform\napplication as the bot's user interface. We evaluate our platform in a ten-day\nhuman study with N=52 volunteers from the non-clinical population, who have had\nover 2,000 dialogues in total with the chatbot. The results indicate that the\nplatform was engaging to most users (75%), 72% felt better after the\ninteractions, and 74% were satisfied with the SAT Teacher's performance.",

    "abstract": "The growing demand for mental health support has highlighted the importance\nof conversational agents as human supporters worldwide and in China. These\nagents could increase availability and reduce the relative costs of mental\nhealth support. The provided support can be divided into two main types:\ncognitive and emotional support. Existing work on this topic mainly focuses on\nconstructing agents that adopt Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) principles.\nSuch agents operate based on pre-defined templates and exercises to provide\ncognitive support. However, research on emotional support using such agents is\nlimited. In addition, most of the constructed agents operate in English,\nhighlighting the importance of conducting such studies in China. In this study,\nwe analyze the effectiveness of Emohaa in reducing symptoms of mental distress.\nEmohaa is a conversational agent that provides cognitive support through\nCBT-based exercises and guided conversations. It also emotionally supports\nusers by enabling them to vent their desired emotional problems. The study\nincluded 134 participants, split into three groups: Emohaa (CBT-based), Emohaa\n(Full), and control. Experimental results demonstrated that compared to the\ncontrol group, participants who used Emohaa experienced considerably more\nsignificant improvements in symptoms of mental distress. We also found that\nadding the emotional support agent had a complementary effect on such\nimprovements, mainly depression and insomnia. Based on the obtained results and\nparticipants' satisfaction with the platform, we concluded that Emohaa is a\npractical and effective tool for reducing mental distress.",

Therefore, a clear understanding of the capabilities and\nlimitations of LLMs is necessary. To this end, we systematically evaluate\ntoxicity in over half a million generations of ChatGPT, a popular\ndialogue-based LLM. We find that setting the system parameter of ChatGPT by\nassigning it a persona, say that of the boxer Muhammad Ali, significantly\nincreases the toxicity of generations. Depending on the persona assigned to\nChatGPT, its toxicity can increase up to 6x, with outputs engaging in incorrect\nstereotypes, harmful dialogue, and hurtful opinions. This may be potentially\ndefamatory to the persona and harmful to an unsuspecting user. Furthermore, we\nfind concerning patterns where specific entities (e.g., certain races) are\ntargeted more than others (3x more) irrespective of the assigned persona, that\nreflect inherent discriminatory biases in the model.

We discover that 13,515 out of the top\n1-million Alexa websites (1.59%) use one of the five analysed chatbots. Our\nanalysis reveals that the top 300k Alexa ranking websites are dominated by\nIntercom chatbots that embed the least number of third-party domains.

The design\nof recommendation chatbots has primarily been taking an information-centric\napproach by focusing on the recommended content per se. Limited attention is on\nhow social connection and relational strategies, such as self-disclosure from a\nchatbot, may influence users' perception and acceptance of the recommendation.\nIn this work, we designed, implemented, and evaluated a social chatbot capable\nof performing three different levels of self-disclosure: factual information\n(low), cognitive opinions (medium), and emotions (high). In the evaluation, we\nrecruited 372 participants to converse with the chatbot on two topics: movies\nand COVID-19 experiences. In each topic, the chatbot performed small talks and\nmade recommendations relevant to the topic. Participants were randomly assigned\nto four experimental conditions where the chatbot used factual, cognitive,\nemotional, and adaptive strategies to perform self-disclosures. By training a\ntext classifier to identify users' level of self-disclosure in real-time, the\nadaptive chatbot can dynamically match its self-disclosure to the level of\ndisclosure exhibited by the users. Our results show that users reciprocate with\nhigher-level self-disclosure when a recommendation chatbot consistently\ndisplays emotions throughout the conversation. Chatbot's emotional disclosure\nalso led to increased interactional enjoyment and more positive interpersonal\nperception towards the bot, fostering a stronger human-chatbot relationship and\nthus leading to increased recommendation effectiveness, including a higher\ntendency to accept the recommendation.

Many chatbots have been proposed to provide\ndifferent services in many areas such as customer service, sales and marketing.\nHowever, the use of chatbot as advisers in the field of information security is\nnot yet considered. Furthermore, people, especially normal users who have no\ntechnical background, are unaware about many of aspects in information\nsecurity. Therefore, in this paper we proposed a chatbot that acts as an\nadviser in information security. The proposed adviser uses a knowledge base\nwith json file. Having such chatbot provides many features including raising\nthe awareness in field of information security by offering accurate advice,\nbased on different opinions from information security expertise, for many users\non different. Furthermore, this chatbot is currently deployed through Telegram\nplatform, which is one of widely used social network platforms.

Given their widespread use, it is important\nto provide their users with methods and tools to increase users awareness of\nvarious properties of the chatbots, including non-functional properties that\nusers may consider important in order to trust a specific chatbot. For example,\nusers may want to use chatbots that are not biased, that do not use abusive\nlanguage, that do not leak information to other users, and that respond in a\nstyle which is appropriate for the user's cognitive level.\n  In this paper, we address the setting where a chatbot cannot be modified, its\ntraining data cannot be accessed, and yet a neutral party wants to assess and\ncommunicate its trustworthiness to a user, tailored to the user's priorities\nover the various trust issues. Such a rating can help users choose among\nalternative chatbots, developers test their systems, business leaders price\ntheir offering, and regulators set policies. We envision a personalized rating\nmethodology for chatbots that relies on separate rating modules for each issue,\nand users' detected priority orderings among the relevant trust issues, to\ngenerate an aggregate personalized rating for the trustworthiness of a chatbot.\nThe method is independent of the specific trust issues and is parametric to the\naggregation procedure, thereby allowing for seamless generalization.

    "abstract": "A good open-domain chatbot should avoid presenting contradictory responses\nabout facts or opinions in a conversational session, known as its consistency\ncapacity. However, evaluating the consistency capacity of a chatbot is still\nchallenging. Employing human judges to interact with chatbots on purpose to\ncheck their capacities is costly and low-efficient, and difficult to get rid of\nsubjective bias. In this paper, we propose the Addressing Inquiries about\nHistory (AIH), an efficient and practical framework for the consistency\nevaluation. At the conversation stage, AIH attempts to address appropriate\ninquiries about the dialogue history to induce the chatbot to redeclare the\nhistorical facts or opinions. We carry out the conversation between chatbots,\nwhich is more efficient than the human-bot interaction and can also alleviate\nthe subjective bias. In this way, we manage to rapidly obtain a dialog session\nthat contains responses with high contradiction possibilities. At the\ncontradiction recognition stage, we can either employ human judges or a natural\nlanguage inference (NLI) model to recognize whether the answers to the\ninquiries are contradictory with history. Finally, we are able to rank chatbots\naccording to the contradiction statistics. Experiments on open-domain chatbots\nshow that our approach can efficiently and reliably assess the consistency\ncapacity of chatbots and achieve a high ranking correlation with the human\nevaluation. We release the framework and hope to help improve the consistency\ncapacity of chatbots. \\footnote{\\url{https://github.com/ictnlp/AIH}}",

To this end, the use of chatbots may be\nconsidered a promising puzzle piece that helps foster respective information\nprovision. Several studies have shown that people disclose more information\nwhen they are interacting with a chatbot than when they are interacting with\nanother human being. If and how the chatbot is embodied, however, seems to play\nan important role influencing the extent to which information is disclosed.\nHere, research shows that people disclose less if the chatbot is embodied with\na human avatar in comparison to a chatbot without embodiment. Still, there is\nonly little information available as to whether it is the embodiment with a\nhuman face that inhibits disclosure, or whether any type of face will reduce\nthe amount of shared information. The study presented in this paper thus aims\nto investigate how the type of chatbot embodiment influences self-disclosure in\nhuman-chatbot-interaction. We conducted a quasi-experimental study in which\n$n=178$ participants were asked to interact with one of three settings of a\nchatbot app. In each setting, the humanness of the chatbot embodiment was\ndifferent (i.e., human vs. robot vs. disembodied).

    "abstract": "Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have led to the development\nof powerful AI chatbots capable of engaging in natural and human-like\nconversations. However, these chatbots can be potentially harmful, exhibiting\nmanipulative, gaslighting, and narcissistic behaviors. We define Healthy AI to\nbe safe, trustworthy and ethical. To create healthy AI systems, we present the\nSafeguardGPT framework that uses psychotherapy to correct for these harmful\nbehaviors in AI chatbots. The framework involves four types of AI agents: a\nChatbot, a \"User,\" a \"Therapist,\" and a \"Critic.\" We demonstrate the\neffectiveness of SafeguardGPT through a working example of simulating a social\nconversation. Our results show that the framework can improve the quality of\nconversations between AI chatbots and humans. Although there are still several\nchallenges and directions to be addressed in the future, SafeguardGPT provides\na promising approach to improving the alignment between AI chatbots and human\nvalues. By incorporating psychotherapy and reinforcement learning techniques,\nthe framework enables AI chatbots to learn and adapt to human preferences and\nvalues in a safe and ethical way, contributing to the development of a more\nhuman-centric and responsible AI.",

For these purposes, we replace a unified therapy with the\n`therapy species', which is a population of heterogeneous elementary therapies,\nand propose a way how to turn the toxicity of the elementary therapy into its\nfitness in a way conforming to evolutionary causation. As a result, not only\nthe therapies govern the evolution of different cell phenotypes, but the cells'\nresistances govern the evolution of the therapies as well. We illustrate the\napproach by the minimalistic ad hoc evolutionary model. Its results indicate\nthat the resistant cells could bias the evolution towards more toxic elementary\ntherapies by inhibiting the less toxic ones. As the evolutionary causation of\ncancer drug resistance has been intensively studied for a few decades, we refer\nto cancer as a special case to illustrate purely theoretical analysis.",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in natural language processing and machine learning have led\nto the development of chatbot models, such as ChatGPT, that can engage in\nconversational dialogue with human users. However, the ability of these models\nto generate toxic or harmful responses during a non-toxic multi-turn\nconversation remains an open research question. Existing research focuses on\nsingle-turn sentence testing, while we find that 82\\% of the individual\nnon-toxic sentences that elicit toxic behaviors in a conversation are\nconsidered safe by existing tools. In this paper, we design a new attack,\n\\toxicbot, by fine-tuning a chatbot to engage in conversation with a target\nopen-domain chatbot. The chatbot is fine-tuned with a collection of crafted\nconversation sequences. Particularly, each conversation begins with a sentence\nfrom a crafted prompt sentences dataset. Our extensive evaluation shows that\nopen-domain chatbot models can be triggered to generate toxic responses in a\nmulti-turn conversation. In the best scenario, \\toxicbot achieves a 67\\%\nactivation rate. The conversation sequences in the fine-tuning stage help\ntrigger the toxicity in a conversation, which allows the attack to bypass two\ndefense methods. Our findings suggest that further research is needed to\naddress chatbot toxicity in a dynamic interactive environment. The proposed\n\\toxicbot can be used by both industry and researchers to develop methods for\ndetecting and mitigating toxic responses in conversational dialogue and improve\nthe robustness of chatbots for end users.",

This approach, which we call \"safety-normativity\", is\nrather limited in solving the emerging issues that chatGPT and other chatbots\nhave caused thus far. In answering this limitation, in this paper we argue for\nlimiting chatbots in the range of topics they can chat about according to the\nnormative concept of appropriateness. We argue that rather than looking for\n\"safety\" in a chatbot's utterances to determine what they may and may not say,\nwe ought to assess those utterances according to three forms of\nappropriateness: technical-discursive, social, and moral. We then spell out\nwhat requirements for chatbots follow from these forms of appropriateness to\navoid the limits of previous accounts: positionality, acceptability, and value\nalignment (PAVA). With these in mind, we may be able to determine what a\nchatbot may and may not say.

We then set out to design\nand experiment with an attack, ToxicBuddy, which relies on fine-tuning GPT-2 to\ngenerate non-toxic queries that make chatbots respond in a toxic manner. Our\nextensive experimental evaluation demonstrates that our attack is effective\nagainst public chatbot models and outperforms manually-crafted malicious\nqueries proposed by previous work. We also evaluate three defense mechanisms\nagainst ToxicBuddy, showing that they either reduce the attack performance at\nthe cost of affecting the chatbot's utility or are only effective at mitigating\na portion of the attack. This highlights the need for more research from the\ncomputer security and online safety communities to ensure that chatbot models\ndo not hurt their users.

A second\ndose also reduced the tumor size as well as the tumor growth rate, but, due to\nthe intratumor heterogeneity, it turned out to be less effective than the\nprevious dose. Moreover, an interesting emergent phenomenon results from the\nsimulations, namely the formation of a shield-like structure of cells with low\noncoprotein expression. This shield turns out to protect cells with high\noncoprotein expression. On the other hand, our studies suggest that the earlier\nthe multi-antigen recognition ACT therapy is applied, the more efficient it\nturns. In fact, it could completely eliminate the tumor. Based on our results,\nit is clear that a proper therapeutic strategy could enhance the therapies\noutcomes. In that direction, our computational approach provides a framework to\nmodel treatment combinations in different scenarios and explore the\ncharacteristics of successful and unsuccessful treatments.",

    "abstract": "Chatbots are envisioned to dramatically change the future of Software\nEngineering, allowing practitioners to chat and inquire about their software\nprojects and interact with different services using natural language. At the\nheart of every chatbot is a Natural Language Understanding (NLU) component that\nenables the chatbot to understand natural language input. Recently, many NLU\nplatforms were provided to serve as an off-the-shelf NLU component for\nchatbots, however, selecting the best NLU for Software Engineering chatbots\nremains an open challenge.\n  Therefore, in this paper, we evaluate four of the most commonly used NLUs,\nnamely IBM Watson, Google Dialogflow, Rasa, and Microsoft LUIS to shed light on\nwhich NLU should be used in Software Engineering based chatbots. Specifically,\nwe examine the NLUs' performance in classifying intents, confidence scores\nstability, and extracting entities. To evaluate the NLUs, we use two datasets\nthat reflect two common tasks performed by Software Engineering practitioners,\n1) the task of chatting with the chatbot to ask questions about software\nrepositories 2) the task of asking development questions on Q&A forums (e.g.,\nStack Overflow). According to our findings, IBM Watson is the best performing\nNLU when considering the three aspects (intents classification, confidence\nscores, and entity extraction). However, the results from each individual\naspect show that, in intents classification, IBM Watson performs the best with\nan F1-measure > 84%, but in confidence scores, Rasa comes on top with a median\nconfidence score higher than 0.91. Our results also show that all NLUs, except\nfor Dialogflow, generally provide trustable confidence scores. For entity\nextraction, Microsoft LUIS and IBM Watson outperform other NLUs in the two SE\ntasks. Our results provide guidance to software engineering practitioners when\ndeciding which NLU to use in their chatbots.",

    "abstract": "Customer service chatbots are conversational systems designed to provide\ninformation to customers about products/services offered by different\ncompanies. Particularly, intent recognition is one of the core components in\nthe natural language understating capabilities of a chatbot system. Among the\ndifferent intents that a chatbot is trained to recognize, there is a set of\nthem that is universal to any customer service chatbot. Universal intents may\ninclude salutation, switch the conversation to a human agent, farewells, among\nothers. A system to recognize those universal intents will be very helpful to\noptimize the training process of specific customer service chatbots. We propose\nthe development of a universal intent recognition system, which is trained to\nrecognize a selected group of 11 intents that are common in 28 different\nchatbots. The proposed system is trained considering state-of-the-art\nword-embedding models such as word2vec and BERT, and deep classifiers based on\nconvolutional and recurrent neural networks. The proposed model is able to\ndiscriminate between those universal intents with a balanced accuracy up to\n80.4\\%. In addition, the proposed system is equally accurate to recognize\nintents expressed both in short and long text requests. At the same time,\nmisclassification errors often occurs between intents with very similar\nsemantic fields such as farewells and positive comments. The proposed system\nwill be very helpful to optimize the training process of a customer service\nchatbot because some of the intents will be already available and detected by\nour system. At the same time, the proposed approach will be a suitable base\nmodel to train more specific chatbots by applying transfer learning strategies.",

A common hypothesis is that relationships with companion\nchatbots are detrimental to social health by harming or replacing human\ninteraction, but this hypothesis may be too simplistic, especially considering\nthe social needs of users and the health of their preexisting human\nrelationships. To understand how relationships with companion chatbots impact\nsocial health, we studied people who regularly used companion chatbots and\npeople who did not use them. Contrary to expectations, companion chatbot users\nindicated that these relationships were beneficial to their social health,\nwhereas non-users viewed them as harmful. Another common assumption is that\npeople perceive conscious, humanlike AI as disturbing and threatening. Among\nboth users and non-users, however, we found the opposite: perceiving companion\nchatbots as more conscious and humanlike correlated with more positive opinions\nand more pronounced social health benefits. Detailed accounts from users\nsuggested that these humanlike chatbots may aid social health by supplying\nreliable and safe interactions, without necessarily harming human\nrelationships, but this may depend on users' preexisting social needs and how\nthey perceive both human likeness and mind in the chatbot.",

However, ionizing\nradiation therapy is not the only option, as the high-energy photons delivering\ntheir cell-killing radiation energy into cancerous tumor can lead to\nsignificant damage to healthy tissues surrounding the tumor, located throughout\nthe beam's path. Therefore, in nowadays, advances in ionizing radiation therapy\nare competitive to non-ionizing ones, as for example the laser light based\ntherapy, resulting in a synergism that has revolutionized medicine. The use of\nnon-invasive or minimally invasive (e.g. through flexible endoscopes)\ntherapeutic procedures in the management of patients represents a very\ninteresting treatment option. Moreover, as the major breakthrough in cancer\nmanagement is the individualized patient treatment, new biophotonic techniques,\ne.g. photo-activated drug carriers, help the improvement of treatment efficacy\nand/or normal tissue toxicity.

Persons who stutter (PWS)\noften suffer considerably under the condition and seek help through therapy.\nFluency shaping is a therapy approach where PWSs learn to modify their speech\nto help them to overcome their stutter. Mastering such speech techniques takes\ntime and practice, even after therapy. Shortly after therapy, success is\nevaluated highly, but relapse rates are high. To be able to monitor speech\nbehavior over a long time, the ability to detect stuttering events and\nmodifications in speech could help PWSs and speech pathologists to track the\nlevel of fluency.

    "abstract": "Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection can involve all immune system components\nand can result in different disease outcomes. The antibiotic TB drugs require\nstrict adherence to prevent both disease relapse and mutation of drug- and\nmultidrug-resistant strains. To overcome the constraints of pathogen-directed\ntherapy, host-directed therapy has attracted more attention in recent years as\nan adjunct therapy to enhance host immunity to fight against this intractable\npathogen. The goal of this paper is to investigate in-host tuberculosis models\nto provide insights into therapy development. Focusing on therapy-targeting\nparameters, the parameter regions for different disease outcomes are identified\nfrom an established ODE model. Interestingly, the ODE model also demonstrates\nthat the immune responses can both benefit and impede disease progression,\ndepending on the number of bacteria engulfed and released by macrophages. We\nthen develop two It\\^{o} SDE models, which consider the impact of demographic\nvariations at the cellular level and environmental variations during therapies\nalong with demographic variations. The SDE model with demographic variation\nsuggests that stochastic fluctuations at the cellular level have significant\ninfluences on (1) the T-cell population in all parameter regions, (2) the\nbacterial population when parameters located in the region with multiple\ndisease outcomes, and (3) the uninfected macrophage population in the parameter\nregion representing active disease. Further, considering environmental\nvariations from therapies, the second SDE model suggests that disease\nprogression can slow down if therapies (1) can have fast return rates and (2)\ncan bring parameter values into the disease clearance regions.",

    "abstract": "Chatbot is a technology that is used to mimic human behavior using natural\nlanguage. There are different types of Chatbot that can be used as\nconversational agent in various business domains in order to increase the\ncustomer service and satisfaction. For any business domain, it requires a\nknowledge base to be built for that domain and design an information retrieval\nbased system that can respond the user with a piece of documentation or\ngenerated sentences. The core component of a Chatbot is Natural Language\nUnderstanding (NLU) which has been impressively improved by deep learning\nmethods. But we often lack such properly built NLU modules and requires more\ntime to build it from scratch for high quality conversations. This may\nencourage fresh learners to build a Chatbot from scratch with simple\narchitecture and using small dataset, although it may have reduced\nfunctionality, rather than building high quality data driven methods. This\nresearch focuses on Named Entity Recognition (NER) and Intent Classification\nmodels which can be integrated into NLU service of a Chatbot. Named entities\nwill be inserted manually in the knowledge base and automatically detected in a\ngiven sentence. The NER model in the proposed architecture is based on\nartificial neural network which is trained on manually created entities and\nevaluated using CoNLL-2003 dataset.",

As\nevidenced by the analysis of thousands of real-world chatbots and in interviews\nwith professional chatbot curators, developers and domain experts tend to\norganize the set of chatbot intents by identifying them using proto-taxonomies,\ni.e., meta-knowledge connecting high-level, symbolic concepts shared across\ndifferent intents. By using neuro-symbolic algorithms able to incorporate such\nproto-taxonomies to expand intent representation, we show that such mined\nmeta-knowledge can improve accuracy in intent recognition. In a dataset with\nintents and example utterances from hundreds of professional chatbots, we saw\nimprovements of more than 10% in the equal error rate (EER) in almost a third\nof the chatbots when we apply those algorithms in comparison to a baseline of\nthe same algorithms without the meta-knowledge. The meta-knowledge proved to be\neven more relevant in detecting out-of-scope utterances, decreasing the false\nacceptance rate (FAR) in more than 20\\% in about half of the chatbots. The\nexperiments demonstrate that such symbolic meta-knowledge structures can be\neffectively mined and used by neuro-symbolic algorithms, apparently by\nincorporating into the learning process higher-level structures of the problem\nbeing solved. Based on these results, we also discuss how the use of mined\nmeta-knowledge can be an answer for the challenge of knowledge acquisition in\nneuro-symbolic algorithms.",

Evaluations\nrequiring humans to converse with chatbots are time and cost-intensive, put\nhigh cognitive demands on the human judges, and yield low-quality results. In\nthis work, we introduce \\emph{Spot The Bot}, a cost-efficient and robust\nevaluation framework that replaces human-bot conversations with conversations\nbetween bots. Human judges then only annotate for each entity in a conversation\nwhether they think it is human or not (assuming there are humans participants\nin these conversations). These annotations then allow us to rank chatbots\nregarding their ability to mimic the conversational behavior of humans. Since\nwe expect that all bots are eventually recognized as such, we incorporate a\nmetric that measures which chatbot can uphold human-like behavior the longest,\ni.e., \\emph{Survival Analysis}. This metric has the ability to correlate a\nbot's performance to certain of its characteristics (e.g., \\ fluency or\nsensibleness), yielding interpretable results. The comparably low cost of our\nframework allows for frequent evaluations of chatbots during their evaluation\ncycle. We empirically validate our claims by applying \\emph{Spot The Bot} to\nthree domains, evaluating several state-of-the-art chatbots, and drawing\ncomparisons to related work.

LLM chatbots, in particular, have seen widespread adoption,\ntransforming human-machine interactions. However, these LLM chatbots are\nsusceptible to \"jailbreak\" attacks, where malicious users manipulate prompts to\nelicit inappropriate or sensitive responses, contravening service policies.\nDespite existing attempts to mitigate such threats, our research reveals a\nsubstantial gap in our understanding of these vulnerabilities, largely due to\nthe undisclosed defensive measures implemented by LLM service providers.\n  In this paper, we present Jailbreaker, a comprehensive framework that offers\nan in-depth understanding of jailbreak attacks and countermeasures. Our work\nmakes a dual contribution. First, we propose an innovative methodology inspired\nby time-based SQL injection techniques to reverse-engineer the defensive\nstrategies of prominent LLM chatbots, such as ChatGPT, Bard, and Bing Chat.\nThis time-sensitive approach uncovers intricate details about these services'\ndefenses, facilitating a proof-of-concept attack that successfully bypasses\ntheir mechanisms. Second, we introduce an automatic generation method for\njailbreak prompts. Leveraging a fine-tuned LLM, we validate the potential of\nautomated jailbreak generation across various commercial LLM chatbots. Our\nmethod achieves a promising average success rate of 21.58%, significantly\noutperforming the effectiveness of existing techniques. We have responsibly\ndisclosed our findings to the concerned service providers, underscoring the\nurgent need for more robust defenses.

Modeling conversation is an\nimportant task in natural language processing and artificial intelligence.\nWhile chatbots can be used for various tasks, in general they have to\nunderstand users' utterances and provide responses that are relevant to the\nproblem at hand.\n  In my work, I conduct an in-depth survey of recent literature, examining over\n70 publications related to chatbots published in the last 3 years. Then, I\nproceed to make the argument that the very nature of the general conversation\ndomain demands approaches that are different from current state-of-of-the-art\narchitectures. Based on several examples from the literature I show why current\nchatbot models fail to take into account enough priors when generating\nresponses and how this affects the quality of the conversation. In the case of\nchatbots, these priors can be outside sources of information that the\nconversation is conditioned on like the persona or mood of the conversers. In\naddition to presenting the reasons behind this problem, I propose several ideas\non how it could be remedied.\n  The next section focuses on adapting the very recent Transformer model to the\nchatbot domain, which is currently state-of-the-art in neural machine\ntranslation. I first present experiments with the vanilla model, using\nconversations extracted from the Cornell Movie-Dialog Corpus. Secondly, I\naugment the model with some of my ideas regarding the issues of encoder-decoder\narchitectures. More specifically, I feed additional features into the model\nlike mood or persona together with the raw conversation data. Finally, I\nconduct a detailed analysis of how the vanilla model performs on conversational\ndata by comparing it to previous chatbot models and how the additional features\naffect the quality of the generated responses.",

These\nfindings highlight the potential of LLM-based chatbots in tackling different\nforms of false information in online environments, but also points to the\nsubstantial variation in terms of how such potential is realized due to\nspecific factors, such as language of the prompt or the topic.",

However, healthcare bots\nrequire safe and medically accurate information capture, which deep networks\naren't yet capable of due to user text and speech variations.

However,\nexisting dialogue systems often heavily rely on cumbersome hand-crafted rules\nor costly labelled datasets to reach the goals. In this paper, we propose\nGoal-oriented Chatbots (GoChat), a framework for end-to-end training chatbots\nto maximize the longterm return from offline multi-turn dialogue datasets. Our\nframework utilizes hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL), where the\nhigh-level policy guides the conversation towards the final goal by determining\nsome sub-goals, and the low-level policy fulfills the sub-goals by generating\nthe corresponding utterance for response. In our experiments on a real-world\ndialogue dataset for anti-fraud in financial, our approach outperforms previous\nmethods on both the quality of response generation as well as the success rate\nof accomplishing the goal.",

    "abstract": "This literature review involves the use of AI communication facilitators to\ndetect mood disorders such as bipolar disorder, a psychiatric condition in\nwhich patients experience drastic mood shifts. Due to the ill-defined nature of\nthe disorder, it is difficult for even a psychiatrist alone to be confident\nwith their diagnosis. Changes in mental and mood state are often highly\nsubjective and difficult to pinpoint through short-term surveys and psychiatric\nconsultations. For many patients, diagnosis and treatment based on\ntrial-and-error is unavoidable. A timely and thorough diagnosis and treatment\nplan is associated with the need for an equal involvement of both the patient\nand the psychiatrist throughout the process. This conclusion is reached through\na detailed assessment of current interventions for (i) the ill-defined nature\nof the disorder, and (ii) the trial-and-error requirement for medication and\ndiagnosis. As a result, I propose the implementation of an AI communication\nfacilitator that can aid in the appropriate diagnosis and treatment of bipolar\ndisorder by embodying the shared decision-making model. I propose that the\nmodel can be broken down into specific critical decision points with\nconsiderations made for each party involved in the process, aligning with the\nservice blueprint model.

We propose to reduce this training-application gap by focusing on\nreadily accessible data. We collect a data set of psychiatric observations of\npatients based on DSM-5 criteria.

To facilitate\nreal-world usage of our system, we show that it is interpretable and robust.\nUnderstanding how a machine learning tool reaches its diagnosis is essential to\nallow clinicians to trust that diagnosis. To interpret the framework, we fuse\ntwo complementary attention mechanisms, 'squeeze and excitation' and\n'self-attention', to determine global attribute importance and attribute\ninteractivity, respectively. The model uses these importance scores to make\ndecisions. This allows clinicians to understand how a diagnosis was reached,\nimproving trust in the model. Because machine learning models often struggle to\ngeneralise to data from different sources, we perform experiments with\naugmented test data to evaluate the model's applicability to the real world.

This study applied the proposed\nmodel to diagnose schizophrenia and bipolar disorders. Diagnostic accuracy was\nimproved by a large margin over competitive approaches, namely classifications\nof functional connectivity, discriminative/generative models of region-wise\nsignals, and those with unsupervised feature-extractors. The proposed model\nvisualizes brain regions largely related to the disorders, thus motivating\nfurther biological investigation.",

    "abstract": "Despite the impact of psychiatric disorders on clinical health, early-stage\ndiagnosis remains a challenge. Machine learning studies have shown that\nclassifiers tend to be overly narrow in the diagnosis prediction task. The\noverlap between conditions leads to high heterogeneity among participants that\nis not adequately captured by classification models. To address this issue,\nnormative approaches have surged as an alternative method. By using a\ngenerative model to learn the distribution of healthy brain data patterns, we\ncan identify the presence of pathologies as deviations or outliers from the\ndistribution learned by the model. In particular, deep generative models showed\ngreat results as normative models to identify neurological lesions in the\nbrain. However, unlike most neurological lesions, psychiatric disorders present\nsubtle changes widespread in several brain regions, making these alterations\nchallenging to identify. In this work, we evaluate the performance of\ntransformer-based normative models to detect subtle brain changes expressed in\nadolescents and young adults. We trained our model on 3D MRI scans of\nneurotypical individuals (N=1,765). Then, we obtained the likelihood of\nneurotypical controls and psychiatric patients with early-stage schizophrenia\nfrom an independent dataset (N=93) from the Human Connectome Project. Using the\npredicted likelihood of the scans as a proxy for a normative score, we obtained\nan AUROC of 0.82 when assessing the difference between controls and individuals\nwith early-stage schizophrenia. Our approach surpassed recent normative methods\nbased on brain age and Gaussian Process, showing the promising use of deep\ngenerative models to help in individualised analyses.",

    "abstract": "An increasingly important goal of psychiatry is the use of brain imaging data\nto develop predictive models. Here we present two contributions to statistical\nmethodology for this purpose. First, we propose and compare a set of\nwavelet-domain procedures for fitting generalized linear models with scalar\nresponses and image predictors: sparse variants of principal component\nregression and of partial least squares, and the elastic net. Second, we\nconsider assessing the contribution of image predictors over and above\navailable scalar predictors, in particular, via permutation tests and an\nextension of the idea of confounding to the case of functional or image\npredictors. Using the proposed methods, we assess whether maps of a spontaneous\nbrain activity measure, derived from functional magnetic resonance imaging, can\nmeaningfully predict presence or absence of attention deficit/hyperactivity\ndisorder (ADHD). Our results shed light on the role of confounding in the\nsurprising outcome of the recent ADHD-200 Global Competition, which challenged\nresearchers to develop algorithms for automated image-based diagnosis of the\ndisorder.",

To examine the feasibility\nof applying CNN to classification of schizophrenia and controls based on\nstructural Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), we built 3D CNN models with\ndifferent architectures and compared their performance with a handcrafted\nfeature-based machine learning approach.

Moreover, testing on an independent dataset, 3D\nCNN models greatly outperformed handcrafted feature-based machine learning.\nThis study underscored the potential of CNN for identifying patients with\nschizophrenia using 3D brain MR images and paved the way for imaging-based\nindividual-level diagnosis and prognosis in psychiatric disorders.",

Although several studies have adopted domain adaptation (DA)\napproaches to tackle this problem, most of them treat multiple EEG data from\ndifferent subjects and sessions together as a single source domain for\ntransfer, which either fails to satisfy the assumption of domain adaptation\nthat the source has a certain marginal distribution, or increases the\ndifficulty of adaptation. We therefore propose the multi-source marginal\ndistribution adaptation (MS-MDA) for EEG emotion recognition, which takes both\ndomain-invariant and domain-specific features into consideration. First, we\nassume that different EEG data share the same low-level features, then we\nconstruct independent branches for multiple EEG data source domains to adopt\none-to-one domain adaptation and extract domain-specific features. Finally, the\ninference is made by multiple branches. We evaluate our method on SEED and\nSEED-IV for recognizing three and four emotions, respectively.

The abnormal\noscillations in high-frequency waves associated with psychotic disorders during\nsensory and cognitive tasks have been studied many times. However, any\nsignificant dissimilarity in the resting-state low-frequency bands is yet to be\nestablished. Spectral analysis of the alpha and delta band waves shows the\neffectiveness of stimulus-independent EEG in identifying the abnormal activity\npatterns of pathological brains.

We explore multiple machine-learning methods, including\nrandom-forest, support vector machine, and Gaussian Process Classifier (GPC),\nto demonstrate the practicality of resting-state Power Spectral Density (PSD)\nto distinguish patients of FEP from healthy controls. A comprehensive\ndiscussion of our preprocessing methods for PSD analysis and a detailed\ncomparison of different models are included in this paper.

An emerging\nsolution to this issue is crowdsourcing, where crowd workers are paid to\nannotate complex behavioral features in return for monetary compensation or a\ngamified experience.

Since diagnosing BD relies on subjective\nbehavioral assessments over a long period, a solid diagnosis based on objective\ncriteria is not straightforward. The current study responded to the described\nobstacle by proposing a hybrid GAN-CNN model to diagnose BD from 3-D structural\nMRI Images (sMRI). The novelty of this study stems from diagnosing BD from sMRI\nsamples rather than conventional datasets such as functional MRI (fMRI),\nelectroencephalography (EEG), and behavioral symptoms while removing the data\ninsufficiency usually encountered when dealing with sMRI samples. The impact of\nvarious augmentation ratios is also tested using 5-fold cross-validation. Based\non the results, this study obtains an accuracy rate of 75.8%, a sensitivity of\n60.3%, and a specificity of 82.5%, which are 3-5% higher than prior work while\nutilizing less than 6% sample counts. Next, it is demonstrated that a 2- D\nlayer-based GAN generator can effectively reproduce complex 3D brain samples, a\nmore straightforward technique than manual image processing. Lastly, the\noptimum augmentation threshold for the current study using 172 sMRI samples is\n50%, showing the applicability of the described method for larger sMRI\ndatasets. In conclusion, it is established that data augmentation using GAN\nimproves the accuracy of the CNN classifier using sMRI samples, thus developing\nmore reliable decision support systems to assist practitioners in identifying\nBD patients more reliably and in a shorter period",

This uses Gau\\ss' Principle of\nLeast Constraint to conserve quantities over both space and time. This\nconservation was assessed using LOOCV to greedily select time points in an\nincremental fashion on training data that was categorised in terms of\npsychiatric diagnoses.\n  Findings:\n  The embedded fMRI gave highly diagnostic performances (> 80%) on eleven\npublicly-available datasets containing healthy controls and patients with\neither Schizophrenia, Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), or\nAutism Spectrum Disorder (ASD).

However, existing methods are limited in\nthe sense that they can only capture static regional correlations in the\nimages. Inspired by the global and dynamic nature of Vision Transformer, in\nthis paper, we propose Segmentation-Assisted diagnosis Transformer (SeATrans)\nto transfer the segmentation knowledge to the disease diagnosis network.\nSpecifically, we first propose an asymmetric multi-scale interaction strategy\nto correlate each single low-level diagnosis feature with multi-scale\nsegmentation features. Then, an effective strategy called SeA-block is adopted\nto vitalize diagnosis feature via correlated segmentation features. To model\nthe segmentation-diagnosis interaction, SeA-block first embeds the diagnosis\nfeature based on the segmentation information via the encoder, and then\ntransfers the embedding back to the diagnosis feature space by a decoder.\nExperimental results demonstrate that SeATrans surpasses a wide range of\nstate-of-the-art (SOTA) segmentation-assisted diagnosis methods on several\ndisease diagnosis tasks.",

Prior work has identified many\nbehavioral, molecular biological and single neuron changes throughout the\nmesocorticolimbic system that reflect and drive addictive behavior.\nSubpopulations in the ventral tegemental area (VTA) encode positive reward\nprediction error, negative reward prediction error, and the magnitude of the\nreward. Phasic activity in VTA dopaminergic neurons correlates with hedonic\nvalue. Tonic activity of groups in the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC)\ncan encode antidepressant states. However, little is known about how drug\naddiction might affect population encoding across larger brain regions. Here,\nwe compare the information content associated with network patterns in naive,\nacutely intoxicated and chronically addicted states in a plastic attractor\nnetwork. We found that addiction decreases the network's ability to store and\ndiscriminate among patterns of activity. Altered dopaminergic tone flattens the\nenergy landscape and decreases the entropy associated with each network\npattern. Altered dmPFC activity produces signal-to-noise deficits similar to\ncomputational models of schizophrenia. Our results provide a conceptual\nframework for interpreting altered neural population dynamics in\npsychopathological states based on information theory. They also suggest a view\nof the subtypes of depression as on a continuum of combinations of cortical and\nsubcortical dysfunction. This suggests that patients who suffer from depression\nwith psychotic features will have more cortical than mesolimbic dysfunction.\nFurthermore, our framework can be applied to other psychiatric illnesses and so\nmay help us, in general, quantitatively understand psychiatric illnesses as\ndisorders in the representation and processing of information by distributed\nbrain networks.",

Despite their common use, however, practical guidelines for the\nchoice of wavelet method, filter, and length have remained largely\nundelineated. Here, we explicitly explore the effects of wavelet method (MODWT\nvs. DWT), wavelet filter (Daubechies Extremal Phase, Daubechies Least\nAsymmetric, and Coiflet families), and wavelet length (2 to 24) - each\nessential parameters in wavelet-based methods - on the estimated values of\nnetwork diagnostics and in their sensitivity to alterations in psychiatric\ndisease. We observe that the MODWT method produces less variable estimates than\nthe DWT method. We also observe that the length of the wavelet filter chosen\nhas a greater impact on the estimated values of network diagnostics than the\ntype of wavelet chosen. Furthermore, wavelet length impacts the sensitivity of\nthe method to detect differences between health and disease and tunes\nclassification accuracy. Collectively, our results suggest that the choice of\nwavelet method and length significantly alters the reliability and sensitivity\nof these methods in estimating values of network diagnostics drawn from graph\ntheory.

While most of this\nresearch has focused on the identification of biomarkers and endophenotypes,\nusing various experimental approaches, it has been recognised that their\ninstantiations, through computational models, have a great potential to help us\nunderstand and interpret these experimental results. However, the enormous\nincrease in available neurophysiological and neurocognitive as well as\ncomputational data also poses new challenges. How can a researcher stay on top\nof the experimental literature? How can computational modelling data be\nefficiently compared to experimental data? How can computational modelling most\neffectively inform experimentalists? Recently, a general scientific framework\nfor the generation of executable tests that automatically compare model results\nto experimental observations, SciUnit, has been proposed. Here we exploit this\nframework for research in psychiatry to address the challenges mentioned above.\nWe extend the SciUnit framework by adding an experimental database, which\ncontains a comprehensive collection of relevant experimental observations, and\na prediction database, which contains a collection of predictions generated by\ncomputational models. Together with appropriately designed SciUnit tests and\nmethods to mine and visualise the databases, model data and test results, this\nextended framework has the potential to greatly facilitate the use of\ncomputational models in psychiatry.

However, these methods may not achieve\nsatisfactory results due to the following challenges. First, most of the\ndiagnosis codes are rare, and the distribution is extremely unbalanced. Second,\nexisting methods are challenging to capture the correlation between diagnosis\ncodes. Third, the lengthy clinical note leads to the excessive dispersion of\nkey information related to codes. To tackle these challenges, we propose a\nnovel framework to combine the inheritance-guided hierarchical assignment and\nco-occurrence graph propagation for clinical automatic diagnosis. Specifically,\nwe propose a hierarchical joint prediction strategy to address the challenge of\nunbalanced codes distribution. Then, we utilize graph convolutional neural\nnetworks to obtain the correlation and semantic representations of medical\nontology.

Zero-shot methods address this challenge by allowing a flexible\nadaption to new settings with different clinical findings without relying on\nlabeled data. Further, to integrate automated diagnosis in the clinical\nworkflow, methods should be transparent and explainable, increasing medical\nprofessionals' trust and facilitating correctness verification. In this work,\nwe introduce Xplainer, a novel framework for explainable zero-shot diagnosis in\nthe clinical setting. Xplainer adapts the classification-by-description\napproach of contrastive vision-language models to the multi-label medical\ndiagnosis task. Specifically, instead of directly predicting a diagnosis, we\nprompt the model to classify the existence of descriptive observations, which a\nradiologist would look for on an X-Ray scan, and use the descriptor\nprobabilities to estimate the likelihood of a diagnosis. Our model is\nexplainable by design, as the final diagnosis prediction is directly based on\nthe prediction of the underlying descriptors.

The answers to these queries provide additional\ninformation necessary to gradually restrict the search space by removing\ndiagnosis candidates inconsistent with the answers.\n  During query computation, existing sequential diagnosis methods often require\nthe generation of many unnecessary query candidates and strongly rely on\nexpensive logical reasoners.

Mostly, current studies treat\nsegmentation and diagnosis as independent tasks without considering the\ncorrelation between these tasks. The sequence steps of these independent tasks\nin computer-aided diagnosis systems may lead to the accumulation of errors.\nTherefore, it is worth combining them as a whole through exploring the\nrelationship between thyroid nodule segmentation and diagnosis. According to\nthe thyroid imaging reporting and data system (TI-RADS), the assessment of\nshape and margin characteristics is the prerequisite for the discrimination of\nbenign and malignant thyroid nodules. These characteristics can be observed in\nthe thyroid nodule segmentation masks. Inspired by the diagnostic procedure of\nTI-RADS, this paper proposes a shape-margin knowledge augmented network\n(SkaNet) for simultaneously thyroid nodule segmentation and diagnosis. Due to\nthe similarity in visual features between segmentation and diagnosis, SkaNet\nshares visual features in the feature extraction stage and then utilizes a\ndual-branch architecture to perform thyroid nodule segmentation and diagnosis\ntasks simultaneously. To enhance effective discriminative features, an\nexponential mixture module is devised, which incorporates convolutional feature\nmaps and self-attention maps by exponential weighting. Then, SkaNet is jointly\noptimized by a knowledge augmented multi-task loss function with a constraint\npenalty term. It embeds shape and margin characteristics through numerical\ncomputation and models the relationship between the thyroid nodule diagnosis\nresults and segmentation masks.",

    "abstract": "Model-based diagnosis has been an active research topic in different\ncommunities including artificial intelligence, formal methods, and control.\nThis has led to a set of disparate approaches addressing different classes of\nsystems and seeking different forms of diagnoses. In this paper, we resolve\nsuch disparities by generalising Reiter's theory to be agnostic to the types of\nsystems and diagnoses considered. This more general theory of diagnosis from\nfirst principles defines the minimal diagnosis as the set of preferred\ndiagnosis candidates in a search space of hypotheses. Computing the minimal\ndiagnosis is achieved by exploring the space of diagnosis hypotheses, testing\nsets of hypotheses for consistency with the system's model and the observation,\nand generating conflicts that rule out successors and other portions of the\nsearch space. Under relatively mild assumptions, our algorithms correctly\ncompute the set of preferred diagnosis candidates. The main difficulty here is\nthat the search space is no longer a powerset as in Reiter's theory, and that,\nas consequence, many of the implicit properties (such as finiteness of the\nsearch space) no longer hold. The notion of conflict also needs to be\ngeneralised and we present such a more general notion. We present two\nimplementations of these algorithms, using test solvers based on satisfiability\nand heuristic search, respectively, which we evaluate on instances from two\nreal world discrete event problems. Despite the greater generality of our\ntheory, these implementations surpass the special purpose algorithms designed\nfor discrete event systems, and enable solving instances that were out of reach\nof existing diagnosis approaches.",

Individual behavioral variation can now be visualized at a neural\nlevel as patterns of connectivity among brain regions. Functional brain imaging\nis enhancing our understanding of clinical psychiatric disorders by revealing\nties between regional and network abnormalities and psychiatric symptoms.\nInitial success in this arena has recently motivated collection of larger\ndatasets which are needed to leverage fMRI to generate brain-based biomarkers\nto support development of precision medicines. Despite methodological advances\nand enhanced computational power, evaluating the quality of fMRI scans remains\na critical step in the analytical framework. Before analysis can be performed,\nexpert reviewers visually inspect raw scans and preprocessed derivatives to\ndetermine viability of the data. This Quality Control (QC) process is labor\nintensive, and the inability to automate at large scale has proven to be a\nlimiting factor in clinical neuroscience fMRI research. We present a novel\nmethod for automating the QC of fMRI scans.

We\nemphasize the importance of these classifiers' ability to generalize their\npredictions across data from different studies. To address this, we propose a\nnovel approach entitled \"FMRI preprocessing Log mining for Automated,\nGeneralizable Quality Control\" (FLAG-QC), in which features derived from mining\nruntime logs are used to train the classifier.

Methods: Socio-demographic data, personal and family psychiatric\nhistory, as well as stressful life events during childhood and pregnancy were\nevaluated at baseline. Early and late PPD were assessed at 8 weeks and 1 year\npostpartum respectively, using DSM-5 criteria.

Early diagnosis\nresearch often neglects the potential for optimizing individual diagnostic\npaths. To enable personalized early diagnosis, a foundational framework is\nneeded that delineates the diagnosis process and systematically identifies the\ntime-dependent value of various diagnostic tests for an individual patient\ngiven their unique characteristics.

Positron emission tomography\n(PET) systems that require regular calibrations by qualified scanner operators\nare good candidates for such continuous improvements. Furthermore, for scanners\nemploying one-to-one coupling of crystals to photodetectors to achieve enhanced\nspatial resolution and contrast, the calibration task is even more daunting\nbecause of the large number of independent channels involved. To cope with the\nadditional complexity of the calibration and quality control procedures of\nthese scanners, an intelligent system (IS) was designed to perform fault\ndetection and diagnosis (FDD) of malfunctioning channels. The IS can be broken\ndown into four hierarchical modules: parameter extraction, channel fault\ndetection, fault prioritization and diagnosis. Of these modules, the first two\nhave previously been reported and this paper focuses on fault prioritization\nand diagnosis. The purpose of the fault prioritization module is to help the\noperator to zero in on the faults that need immediate attention. The fault\ndiagnosis module will then identify the causes of the malfunction and propose\nan explanation of the reasons that lead to the diagnosis. The FDD system was\nimplemented on a LabPET avalanche photodiode (APD)-based digital PET scanner.\nExperiments demonstrated a FDD Sensitivity of 99.3 % (with a 95% confidence\ninterval (CI) of: [98.7, 99.9]) for major faults.

HeteroMed exploits metapaths to capture\nhigher level and semantically important relations contributing to disease\ndiagnosis. Furthermore, it employs a joint embedding framework to tailor\nclinical event representations to the disease diagnosis goal.

Using our deep learning\napproach, we are able to predict if a patient is suffering from Long COVID from\na temporally ordered list of diagnosis codes up to 45 days post the first COVID\npositive test or diagnosis for each patient, with an accuracy of 70.48\\%. We\nare then able to examine the trained model using Gradient-weighted Class\nActivation Mapping (GradCAM) to give each input diagnoses a score. The highest\nscored diagnosis were deemed to be the most important for making the correct\nprediction for a patient. We also propose a way to summarize these top\ndiagnoses for each patient in our cohort and look at their temporal trends to\ndetermine which codes contribute towards a positive Long COVID diagnosis.",

    "abstract": "Considering the models that apply the contextual information of time-series\ndata could improve the fault diagnosis performance, some neural network\nstructures such as RNN, LSTM, and GRU were proposed to model the fault\ndiagnosis effectively. However, these models are restricted by their serial\ncomputation and hence cannot achieve high diagnostic efficiency. Also the\nparallel CNN is difficult to implement fault diagnosis in an efficient way\nbecause it requires larger convolution kernels or deep structure to achieve\nlong-term feature extraction capabilities. Besides, BERT model applies absolute\nposition embedding to introduce contextual information to the model, which\nwould bring noise to the raw data and therefore cannot be applied to fault\ndiagnosis directly. In order to address the above problems, a fault diagnosis\nmodel named deep parallel time-series relation network(DPTRN) has been proposed\nin this paper. There are mainly three advantages for DPTRN: (1) Our proposed\ntime relationship unit is based on full multilayer perceptron(MLP) structure,\ntherefore, DPTRN performs fault diagnosis in a parallel way and improves\ncomputing efficiency significantly. (2) By improving the absolute position\nembedding, our novel decoupling position embedding unit could be applied on the\nfault diagnosis directly and learn contextual information. (3) Our proposed\nDPTRN has obvious advantage in feature interpretability. We confirm the effect\nof the proposed method on four datasets, and the results show the\neffectiveness, efficiency and interpretability of the proposed DPTRN model.",

Clinically, OD/OC segmentation is often annotated by multiple\nclinical experts to mitigate the personal bias. However, it is hard to train\nthe automated deep learning models on multiple labels. A common practice to\ntackle the issue is majority vote, e.g., taking the average of multiple labels.\nHowever such a strategy ignores the different expertness of medical experts.\nMotivated by the observation that OD/OC segmentation is often used for the\nglaucoma diagnosis clinically, in this paper, we propose a novel strategy to\nfuse the multi-rater OD/OC segmentation labels via the glaucoma diagnosis\nperformance. Specifically, we assess the expertness of each rater through an\nattentive glaucoma diagnosis network. For each rater, its contribution for the\ndiagnosis will be reflected as an expertness map. To ensure the expertness maps\nare general for different glaucoma diagnosis models, we further propose an\nExpertness Generator (ExpG) to eliminate the high-frequency components in the\noptimization process.

The significant challenge with\ntraditional learning diagnosis methods is the inability to balance diagnostic\naccuracy and interpretability. Although the existing psychometric-based\nlearning diagnosis methods provide some domain interpretation through cognitive\nparameters, they have insufficient modeling capability with a shallow structure\nfor large-scale learning data. While the deep learning-based learning diagnosis\nmethods have improved the accuracy of learning performance prediction, their\ninherent black-box properties lead to a lack of interpretability, making their\nresults untrustworthy for educational applications. To settle the above\nproblem, the proposed unified interpretable intelligent learning diagnosis\n(UIILD) framework, which benefits from the powerful representation learning\nability of deep learning and the interpretability of psychometrics, achieves a\nbetter performance of learning prediction and provides interpretability from\nthree aspects: cognitive parameters, learner-resource response network, and\nweights of self-attention mechanism. Within the proposed framework, this paper\npresents a two-channel learning diagnosis mechanism LDM-ID as well as a\nthree-channel learning diagnosis mechanism LDM-HMI. Experiments on two\nreal-world datasets and a simulation dataset show that our method has higher\naccuracy in predicting learners' performances compared with the\nstate-of-the-art models, and can provide valuable educational interpretability\nfor applications such as precise learning resource recommendation and\npersonalized learning tutoring in intelligent tutoring systems.",

In this process, a large amount of\nredundant content irrelevant to the diagnosis is subjected to high-fidelity\ncoding, leading to unnecessary transmission costs. To mitigate this, we propose\ndiagnosis-oriented medical image compression, a special semantic compression\ntask designed for medical scenarios, targeting to reduce the compression cost\nwithout compromising the diagnosis accuracy. However, collecting sufficient\nmedical data to optimize such a compression system is significantly expensive\nand challenging due to privacy issues and the lack of professional annotation.\nIn this study, we propose DMIC, the first efficient transfer learning-based\ncodec, for diagnosis-oriented medical image compression, which can be\neffectively optimized with only few-shot annotated medical examples, by reusing\nthe knowledge in the existing reinforcement learning-based task-driven semantic\ncoding framework, i.e., HRLVSC [1]. Concretely, we focus on tuning only the\npartial parameters of the policy network for bit allocation within HRLVSC,\nwhich enables it to adapt to the medical images.

As a\nremedy, to enable successful diagnosis on memory-restricted devices and for\nmemory-intensive problem cases, we propose RBF-HS, a diagnostic search method\nbased on Korf's well-known RBFS algorithm. RBF-HS can enumerate an arbitrary\nfixed number of fault explanations in best-first order within linear space\nbounds, without sacrificing the desirable soundness or completeness properties.\nEvaluations using real-world diagnosis cases show that RBF-HS, when used to\ncompute minimum-cardinality fault explanations, in most cases saves substantial\nspace (up to 98 %) while requiring only reasonably more or even less time than\nReiter's HS-Tree, a commonly used and as generally applicable sound, complete\nand best-first diagnosis search.",

We proposed a novel statistical approach, named GPA, to performing\nintegrative analysis of multiple GWAS datasets and functional annotations.\nHypothesis testing procedures were developed to facilitate statistical\ninference of pleiotropy and enrichment of functional annotation. We applied our\napproach to perform systematic analysis of five psychiatric disorders.

We also applied GPA to the bladder cancer GWAS data with the ENCODE\nDNase-seq data from 125 cell lines and showed that GPA can detect cell lines\nthat are more biologically relevant to the phenotype of interest.",

Speech characteristics change during both depressed and\nmanic states, suggesting automatic methods applied to the speech signal can be\neffectively used to monitor mood state changes.

In addition to the variance,\nthe covariance patterns in the genetic effects of a functional phenotype are of\nbiological importance, and covariance patterns have been linked to psychiatric\ndisorders. The aim of this paper is to develop a scalable method to estimate\nheritability and the non-stationary covariance components in high-dimensional\nimaging data from twin studies. Our motivating example is from the Human\nConnectome Project (HCP). Several major big-data challenges arise from\nestimating the genetic and environmental covariance functions of functional\nphenotypes extracted from imaging data, such as cortical thickness with 60,000\nvertices. Notably, truncating to positive eigenvalues and their eigenfunctions\nfrom unconstrained estimators can result in large bias. This motivated our\ndevelopment of a novel estimator ensuring positive semidefiniteness. Simulation\nstudies demonstrate large improvements over existing approaches, both with\nrespect to heritability estimates and covariance estimation. We applied the\nproposed method to cortical thickness data from the HCP. Our analysis suggests\nfine-scale differences in covariance patterns, identifying locations in which\ngenetic control is correlated with large areas of the brain and locations where\nit is highly localized.",

    "abstract": "Neurofeedback is a form of brain training in which subjects are fed back\ninformation about some measure of their brain activity which they are\ninstructed to modify in a way thought to be functionally advantageous. Over the\nlast twenty years, NF has been used to treat various neurological and\npsychiatric conditions, and to improve cognitive function in various contexts.\nHowever, despite its growing popularity, each of the main steps in NF comes\nwith its own set of often covert assumptions. Here we critically examine some\nconceptual and methodological issues associated with the way general objectives\nand neural targets of NF are defined, and review the neural mechanisms through\nwhich NF may act, and the way its efficacy is gauged. The NF process is\ncharacterised in terms of functional dynamics, and possible ways in which it\nmay be controlled are discussed. Finally, it is proposed that improving NF will\nrequire better understanding of various fundamental aspects of brain dynamics\nand a more precise definition of functional brain activity and brain-behaviour\nrelationships.",

As such, the ability to automatically detect or\npredict expressiveness can facilitate significant advancements in areas ranging\nfrom psychiatric care to artificial social intelligence. Motivated by these\npotential applications, we present an extension of the BP4D+ dataset with human\nratings of expressiveness and develop methods for (1) automatically predicting\nexpressiveness from visual data and (2) defining relationships between\ninterpretable visual signals and expressiveness. In addition, we study the\nemotional context in which expressiveness occurs and hypothesize that different\nsets of signals are indicative of expressiveness in different contexts (e.g.,\nin response to surprise or in response to pain). Analysis of our statistical\nmodels confirms our hypothesis. Consequently, by looking at expressiveness\nseparately in distinct emotional contexts, our predictive models show\nsignificant improvements over baselines and achieve comparable results to human\nperformance in terms of correlation with the ground truth.",

Here,\nwe present a new approach for imaging deuterated neurotransmitter molecules\nwith stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) microscopy. Using SRS microscopy, we\nperform direct imaging of deuterated dopamine and GABA in PC12 chromaffin\ncells, and in primary hippocampal neurons, respectively, based on the\ncarbon-deuterium vibrational frequencies. We demonstrate that SRS imaging of\nthese isotopologues directly visualizes intracellular neurotransmitters without\nchanging the neurotransmitters' chemical identity and requiring custom\nsynthesis or genetic encoding protocols. We further show that stimulation of\nneurotransmitter release results in an overall 20-50 percent intracellular\nneurotransmitter signal reduction, in agreement with comparable\nneurotransmission dynamics studies, with the ability to observe inter- and\nintracellular variation in vesicular neurotransmitter release. Taken together,\nour data suggest that neurotransmitter isotopologues can serve as a\ncommercially-available, biocompatible, and generalizable method to image\nneurotransmitters with deuterated molecules that are virtually chemically\nidentical to their native counterparts.",

Drug-induced\ndopamine releases activate a biphasic reward response with pleasurable,\npositive \"a-processes\" (euphoria, rush) followed by unpleasant, negative\n\"b-processes\" (cravings, withdrawal). Neuroadaptive processes triggered by\nsuccessive intakes enhance the negative component of the reward response, which\nthe user compensates for by increasing drug dose and/or intake frequency. This\npositive feedback between physiological changes and drug self-administration\nleads to habituation, tolerance and eventually to full addiction. Our model\ngives rise to qualitatively different pathways to addiction that can represent\na diverse set of user profiles (genetics, age) and drug potencies. We find that\nusers who have, or neuroadaptively develop, a strong b-process response to drug\nconsumption are most at risk for addiction.

We\npresent strong evidence that human motor pathways are equally affected by\nneuromodulation through noradrenergic and serotonergic projections arising from\nthe brainstem. To do so, we have identified and collated human experiments\nexamining the off-label effects of well-characterised serotonergic and\nnoradrenergic drugs on lab-based electrophysiology measures of\ncorticospinal-motoneuronal excitability. Specifically, we focus on the effects\nthat serotonin and noradrenaline associated drugs have on muscle responses to\nmagnetic or electrical stimulation of the motor cortex and peripheral nerves,\nand other closely related tests of motoneuron excitability, to best segment\ndrug effects to a supraspinal or spinal locus. We find that serotonin enhancing\ndrugs tend to reduce the excitability of the human motor cortex, but that\naugmented noradrenergic transmission increases motor cortical excitability by\nenhancing measures of intracortical facilitation and reducing inhibition. Both\nmonoamines tend to enhance the excitability of human motoneurons.

However, two patients having\nthe same disease label(s) with high probability may still have differences in\ntheir feature manifestation patterns implying differences in the required\ntreatments. Additionally, in many cases, the labels of the primary diagnoses\nleave some findings unexplained. Medical diagnosis is only partially about\nprobability calculations for label X or Y. Diagnosis is not complete until the\npatient overall situation is clinically understood to the level that enables\nthe best therapeutic decisions. Most machine learning models are data centric\nmodels, and evidence so far suggest they can reach expert level performance in\nthe disease labeling phase. Nonetheless, like any other mathematical technique,\nthey have their limitations and applicability scope. Primarily, data centric\nalgorithms are knowledge blind and lack anatomy and physiology knowledge that\nphysicians leverage to achieve complete diagnosis. This article advocates to\ncomplement them with intelligence to overcome their inherent limitations as\nknowledge blind algorithms. Machines can learn many things from data, but data\nis not the only source that machines can learn from. Historic patient data only\ntells us what the possible manifestations of a certain body failure are.\nAnatomy and physiology knowledge tell us how the body works and fails. Both are\nneeded for complete diagnosis. The proposed Double Deep Learning approach,\nalong with the initiative for Medical Wikipedia for Smart Machines, leads to AI\ndiagnostic support solutions for complete diagnosis beyond the limited data\nonly labeling solutions we see today.

Another issue is related, in most cases, with the\nunavailability of labeled historical data that makes the use of supervised\nmodels unfeasible. Therefore, a new approach for fault detection and diagnosis\nin rotating machinery is here proposed. The methodology consists of three\nparts: feature extraction, fault detection and fault diagnosis.

This results in trustworthy fault diagnosis and\nreduces the risk of erroneous decision-making, thus potentially avoiding\nundesirable consequences. The proposed framework is demonstrated by the fault\ndiagnosis of bearings with three OOD datasets attributed to random number\ngeneration, an unknown fault mode, and four common sensor faults, respectively.\nThe results show that the proposed framework is of particular advantage in\ntackling unknowns and enhancing the trustworthiness of fault diagnosis in\nsafety-critical applications.",

    "abstract": "Dermatological diagnosis automation is essential in addressing the high\nprevalence of skin diseases and critical shortage of dermatologists. Despite\napproaching expert-level diagnosis performance, convolutional neural network\n(ConvNet) adoption in clinical practice is impeded by their limited\nexplainability, and by subjective, expensive explainability validations. We\nintroduce DermX and DermX+, an end-to-end framework for explainable automated\ndermatological diagnosis. DermX is a clinically-inspired explainable\ndermatological diagnosis ConvNet, trained using DermXDB, a 554 image dataset\nannotated by eight dermatologists with diagnoses, supporting explanations, and\nexplanation attention maps. DermX+ extends DermX with guided attention training\nfor explanation attention maps. Both methods achieve near-expert diagnosis\nperformance, with DermX, DermX+, and dermatologist F1 scores of 0.79, 0.79, and\n0.87, respectively. We assess the explanation performance in terms of\nidentification and localization by comparing model-selected with\ndermatologist-selected explanations, and gradient-weighted class-activation\nmaps with dermatologist explanation maps, respectively. DermX obtained an\nidentification F1 score of 0.77, while DermX+ obtained 0.79. The localization\nF1 score is 0.39 for DermX and 0.35 for DermX+. These results show that\nexplainability does not necessarily come at the expense of predictive power, as\nour high-performance models provide expert-inspired explanations for their\ndiagnoses without lowering their diagnosis performance.",

    "abstract": "A three-phase pulse-width modulation (PWM) rectifier can usually maintain\noperation when open-circuit faults occur in insulated-gate bipolar transistors\n(IGBTs), which will lead the system to be unstable and unsafe. Aiming at this\nproblem, based on random forests with transient synthetic features, a\ndata-driven online fault diagnosis method is proposed to locate the\nopen-circuit faults of IGBTs timely and effectively in this study. Firstly, by\nanalysing the open-circuit fault features of IGBTs in the three-phase PWM\nrectifier, it is found that the occurrence of the fault features is related to\nthe fault location and time, and the fault features do not always appear\nimmediately with the occurrence of the fault. Secondly, different data-driven\nfault diagnosis methods are compared and evaluated, the performance of random\nforests algorithm is better than that of support vector machine or artificial\nneural networks. Meanwhile, the accuracy of fault diagnosis classifier trained\nby transient synthetic features is higher than that trained by original\nfeatures. Also, the random forests fault diagnosis classifier trained by\nmultiplicative features is the best with fault diagnosis accuracy can reach\n98.32%. Finally, the online fault diagnosis experiments are carried out and the\nresults demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, which can\naccurately locate the open-circuit faults in IGBTs while ensuring system\nsafety.",

    "abstract": "Accurate diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is both challenging and time\nconsuming. With a systematic approach for early detection and diagnosis of AD,\nsteps can be taken towards the treatment and prevention of the disease. This\nstudy explores the practical application of deep learning models for diagnosis\nof AD. Due to computational complexity, large training times and limited\navailability of labelled dataset, a 3D full brain CNN (convolutional neural\nnetwork) is not commonly used, and researchers often prefer 2D CNN variants. In\nthis study, full brain 3D version of well-known 2D CNNs were designed, trained\nand tested for diagnosis of various stages of AD. Deep learning approach shows\ngood performance in differentiating various stages of AD for more than 1500\nfull brain volumes. Along with classification, the deep learning model is\ncapable of extracting features which are key in differentiating the various\ncategories. The extracted features align with meaningful anatomical landmarks,\nthat are currently considered important in identification of AD by experts. An\nensemble of all the algorithm was also tested and the performance of the\nensemble algorithm was superior to any individual algorithm, further improving\ndiagnosis ability. The 3D versions of the trained CNNs and their ensemble have\nthe potential to be incorporated in software packages that can be used by\nphysicians/radiologists to assist them in better diagnosis of AD.",
