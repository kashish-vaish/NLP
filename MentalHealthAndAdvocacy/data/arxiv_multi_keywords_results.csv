  in Simulating Depressed Individuals on the Standardized Depressive Symptom
  Scale","['Sijin Cai', 'Nanfeng Zhang', 'Jiaying Zhu', 'Yanjie Liu', 'Yongjin Zhou']","Background: Depression is a common mental disorder with societal and economic
burden. Current diagnosis relies on self-reports and assessment scales, which
have reliability issues. Objective approaches are needed for diagnosing
depression. Objective: Evaluate the potential of GPT technology in diagnosing
depression. Assess its ability to simulate individuals with depression and
investigate the influence of depression scales. Methods: Three
depression-related assessment tools (HAMD-17, SDS, GDS-15) were used. Two
experiments simulated GPT responses to normal individuals and individuals with
depression. Compare GPT's responses with expected results, assess its
understanding of depressive symptoms, and performance differences under
different conditions. Results: GPT's performance in depression assessment was
evaluated. It aligned with scoring criteria for both individuals with
depression and normal individuals. Some performance differences were observed
based on depression severity. GPT performed better on scales with higher
sensitivity. Conclusion: GPT accurately simulates individuals with depression
and normal individuals during depression-related assessments. Deviations occur
when simulating different degrees of depression, limiting understanding of mild
and moderate cases. GPT performs better on scales with higher sensitivity,
indicating potential for developing more effective depression scales. GPT has
important potential in depression assessment, supporting clinicians and
patients.",2023,http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.08576v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.08576v1
depression,Non-verbal Facial Action Units-based Automatic Depression Classification,['Chuang Yu'],"Depression is a common mental disorder that causes people to experience
depressed mood, loss of interest or pleasure, feelings of guilt or low
self-worth. Traditional clinical depression diagnosis methods are subjective
and time consuming. Since depression can be reflected by human facial
expressions, We propose a non-verbal facial behavior-based automatic depression
classification approach. In this paper, both short-term behavior-based and
clip-based depression classification are constructed. The final clip-level
decision of short-term behavior-based depression detection is yielded by
averaging the predictions of all short-term behaviors while we modelling
behaviors contained in all frames based on two Gaussian Mixture Models. To
evaluate the proposed approaches, we select a gender balanced subset from AVEC
2019 depression corpus containing 30 participants. The experimental results
show that our method achieved more than 75% depression classification accuracy,
where both GMM-based clip-level depression modelling and rank pooling-based
short-term depression behavior modelling achieved at least 70% classification
accuracy. The result indicates that our approach can leverage complementary

facial behaviors.",2022,http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.10911v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.10911v1

  Recognition using Graph Representation","['Jiaqi Xu', 'Siyang Song', 'Keerthy Kusumam', 'Hatice Gunes', 'Michel Valstar']","Video-based automatic depression analysis provides a fast, objective and
repeatable self-assessment solution, which has been widely developed in recent
years. While depression clues may be reflected by human facial behaviours of
various temporal scales, most existing approaches either focused on modelling
depression from short-term or video-level facial behaviours. In this sense, we
propose a two-stage framework that models depression severity from multi-scale
short-term and video-level facial behaviours. The short-term depressive
behaviour modelling stage first deep learns depression-related facial
behavioural features from multiple short temporal scales, where a Depression
Feature Enhancement (DFE) module is proposed to enhance the depression-related
clues for all temporal scales and remove non-depression noises. Then, the
video-level depressive behaviour modelling stage proposes two novel graph
encoding strategies, i.e., Sequential Graph Representation (SEG) and Spectral
Graph Representation (SPG), to re-encode all short-term features of the target
video into a video-level graph representation, summarizing depression-related
multi-scale video-level temporal information. As a result, the produced graph
representations predict depression severity using both short-term and long-term
facial beahviour patterns. The experimental results on AVEC 2013 and AVEC 2014
datasets show that the proposed DFE module constantly enhanced the depression
severity estimation performance for various CNN models while the SPG is
superior than other video-level modelling methods. More importantly, the result
achieved for the proposed two-stage framework shows its promising and solid
performance compared to widely-used one-stage modelling approaches.",2021,http://arxiv.org/abs/2111.15266v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.15266v1
depression,Towards More Efficient Depression Risk Recognition via Gait,"['Min Ren', 'Muchan Tao', 'Xuecai Hu', 'Xiaotong Liu', 'Qiong Li', 'Yongzhen Huang']","Depression, a highly prevalent mental illness, affects over 280 million
individuals worldwide. Early detection and timely intervention are crucial for
promoting remission, preventing relapse, and alleviating the emotional and
financial burdens associated with depression. However, patients with depression
often go undiagnosed in the primary care setting. Unlike many physiological
illnesses, depression lacks objective indicators for recognizing depression
risk, and existing methods for depression risk recognition are time-consuming
and often encounter a shortage of trained medical professionals. The
correlation between gait and depression risk has been empirically established.
Gait can serve as a promising objective biomarker, offering the advantage of
efficient and convenient data collection. However, current methods for
recognizing depression risk based on gait have only been validated on small,
private datasets, lacking large-scale publicly available datasets for research
purposes. Additionally, these methods are primarily limited to hand-crafted
approaches. Gait is a complex form of motion, and hand-crafted gait features
often only capture a fraction of the intricate associations between gait and
depression risk. Therefore, this study first constructs a large-scale gait
database, encompassing over 1,200 individuals, 40,000 gait sequences, and
covering six perspectives and three types of attire. Two commonly used
psychological scales are provided as depression risk annotations. Subsequently,
a deep learning-based depression risk recognition model is proposed, overcoming
the limitations of hand-crafted approaches. Through experiments conducted on
the constructed large-scale database, the effectiveness of the proposed method
is validated, and numerous instructive insights are presented in the paper,
highlighting the significant potential of gait-based depression risk
recognition.",2023,http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06283v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.06283v1

depression,"An Ambient Intelligence-based Approach For Longitudinal Monitoring of
  Verbal and Vocal Depression Symptoms","['Alice Othmani', 'Muhammad Muzammel']","Automatic speech recognition (ASR) technology can aid in the detection,
monitoring, and assessment of depressive symptoms in individuals. ASR systems
have been used as a tool to analyze speech patterns and characteristics that
are indicative of depression. Depression affects not only a person's mood but
also their speech patterns. Individuals with depression may exhibit changes in
speech, such as slower speech rate, longer pauses, reduced pitch variability,
and decreased overall speech fluency. Despite the growing use of machine
learning in diagnosing depression, there is a lack of studies addressing the
issue of relapse. Furthermore, previous research on relapse prediction has
primarily focused on clinical variables and has not taken into account other
factors such as verbal and non-verbal cues. Another major challenge in
depression relapse research is the scarcity of publicly available datasets. To
overcome these issues, we propose a one-shot learning framework for detecting
depression relapse from speech. We define depression relapse as the similarity
between the speech audio and textual encoding of a subject and that of a
depressed individual. To detect depression relapse based on this definition, we
employ a Siamese neural network that models the similarity between of two
instances. Our proposed approach shows promising results and represents a new
advancement in the field of automatic depression relapse detection and mental

epilepsy and depression, but it is unclear how depressive symptoms in patients
with epilepsy are affected by slow wave sleep duration and clinical factors,
and how the spectral characteristics of slow wave sleep reflect a potential
interaction of epilepsy and depression. Long-term video-EEG monitoring was
conducted in 51 patients with focal epilepsy, 13 patients with generalized
epilepsy, and 9 patients without epilepsy. Slow wave sleep segments were
manually marked in the EEG and duration as well as EEG power spectra were
extracted. Depressive symptoms were documented with the Beck Depression
Inventory (BDI). At least mild depressive symptoms (BDI>9) were found among 23
patients with focal epilepsy, 5 patients with generalised epilepsy, and 6
patients who had no epilepsy diagnosis. Slow wave sleep duration was shorter
for patients with at least mild depressive symptoms (p=.004), independently
from epilepsy diagnosis, antiseizure medication, age, and sex. Psychoactive
medication was associated with longer slow wave sleep duration (p=.008).
Frontal sigma band power (13-15 Hz) during slow wave sleep was higher for
patients without epilepsy and without depressive symptoms as compared to
patients without depressive symptoms but with focal epilepsy (p=.005).
Depressive symptoms affect slow wave sleep duration of patients with epilepsy
similarly as in patients without epilepsy. Since reduced slow wave sleep can
increase the likelihood of seizure occurrence, these results stress the

predicting future depression using machine learning applied to longitudinal
socio-demographic data. In doing so we show that data such as housing status,
and the details of the family environment, can provide cues for predicting
future psychiatric disorders. To this end, we introduce a novel deep multi-task
recurrent neural network to learn time-dependent depression cues. The
depression prediction task is jointly optimized with two auxiliary anomaly
ranking tasks, including contrastive one-class feature ranking and deviation
ranking. The auxiliary tasks address two key challenges of the problem: 1) the
high within class variance of depression samples: they enable the learning of
representations that are robust to highly variant in-class distribution of the
depression samples; and 2) the small labeled data volume: they significantly
enhance the sample efficiency of the prediction model, which reduces the
reliance on large depression-labeled datasets that are difficult to collect in

depression,Social interaction networks and depressive symptoms,"['Timon Elmer', 'Christoph Stadtfeld']","Face-to-face social interactions are an important aspect of peoples' social
lives. A lack of interactions can explain how individuals develop depressive
symptoms, but depressive symptoms can also explain how individuals engage in
social interactions. Understanding in detail how depression affects
individuals' social interaction networks is important to break this vicious
cycle of social isolation and depression. This article tackles two central
methodological challenges in understanding the micro-level mechanisms between
depressive symptoms and social interactions. The first contribution is the
application of novel data collection strategies that employ RFID sensors to
record behavioral data on interpersonal interaction, which we combine with
self-reported depressive symptoms and sociometric data on friendship relations.
The second contribution is the analysis of these data with statistical social
network methodology that allows testing hypotheses on the duration of
interactions between pairs of individuals. With this unique approach, we test
four social network hypotheses in an empirical setting of two first-year
undergraduate student cohorts (N(pairs) = 2,454, N(individuals) = 123) spending
a weekend together in a remote camp house. We conclude that depressive symptoms
are associated with (1) spending less time in social interaction, (2) spending
time with similarly depressed others, (3) spending time in pair-wise
interactions rather than group interactions, and with (4) spending more time
with reciprocal friends (but not with unilaterally perceived friends). Our
findings offer new insights into social consequences of depressive symptoms and
call for the development of social network-oriented intervention strategies to
prevent depressed individuals from being socially isolated.",2018,http://arxiv.org/abs/1811.07740v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1811.07740v1

Questionnaire, which is frequently used to gauge the severity of depression, is
one instrument that can aid in this study. We can narrow our study to only
those symptoms since each BDI question is linked to a particular depressive
symptom. It's important to remember that not everyone with depression exhibits
all symptoms at once, but rather a combination of them. Therefore, it is
extremely useful to be able to determine if a sentence or a piece of

depression,"Depression Detection Using Digital Traces on Social Media: A
  Knowledge-aware Deep Learning Approach","['Wenli Zhang', 'Jiaheng Xie', 'Zhu Zhang', 'Xiang Liu']","Depression is a common disease worldwide. It is difficult to diagnose and
continues to be underdiagnosed. Because depressed patients constantly share
their symptoms, major life events, and treatments on social media, researchers
are turning to user-generated digital traces on social media for depression
detection. Such methods have distinct advantages in combating depression
because they can facilitate innovative approaches to fight depression and
alleviate its social and economic burden. However, most existing studies lack
effective means to incorporate established medical domain knowledge in
depression detection or suffer from feature extraction difficulties that impede
greater performance. Following the design science research paradigm, we propose
a Deep Knowledge-aware Depression Detection (DKDD) framework to accurately
detect social media users at risk of depression and explain the critical
factors that contribute to such detection. Extensive empirical studies with
real-world data demonstrate that, by incorporating domain knowledge, our method
outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods. Our work has significant
implications for IS research in knowledge-aware machine learning, digital
traces utilization, and NLP research in IS. Practically, by providing early
detection and explaining the critical factors, DKDD can supplement clinical
depression screening and enable large-scale evaluations of a population's
mental health status.",2023,http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.05389v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.05389v2

  Detection in Social Media","['Junwei Kuang', 'Jiaheng Xie', 'Zhijun Yan']","Depression is the most prevalent and serious mental illness, which induces
grave financial and societal ramifications. Depression detection is key for
early intervention to mitigate those consequences. Such a high-stake decision
inherently necessitates interpretability. Although a few depression detection
studies attempt to explain the decision based on the importance score or
attention weights, these explanations misalign with the clinical depression
diagnosis criterion that is based on depressive symptoms. To fill this gap, we
follow the computational design science paradigm to develop a novel Multi-Scale
Temporal Prototype Network (MSTPNet). MSTPNet innovatively detects and
interprets depressive symptoms as well as how long they last. Extensive
empirical analyses using a large-scale dataset show that MSTPNet outperforms
state-of-the-art depression detection methods with an F1-score of 0.851. This
result also reveals new symptoms that are unnoted in the survey approach, such
as sharing admiration for a different life. We further conduct a user study to
demonstrate its superiority over the benchmarks in interpretability. This study
contributes to IS literature with a novel interpretable deep learning model for

  Vulnerability to Depression","['Runa Bhaumik', 'Jonathan Stange']","Background: Reliable prediction of clinical progression over time can improve
the outcomes of depression. Little work has been done integrating various risk
factors for depression, to determine the combinations of factors with the
greatest utility for identifying which individuals are at the greatest risk.
Method: This study demonstrates that data-driven machine learning (ML) methods
such as RE-EM (Random Effects/Expectation Maximization) trees and MERF (Mixed
Effects Random Forest) can be applied to reliably identify variables that have
the greatest utility for classifying subgroups at greatest risk for depression.
185 young adults completed measures of depression risk, including rumination,
worry, negative cognitive styles, cognitive and coping flexibilities, and
negative life events, along with symptoms of depression. We trained RE-EM trees
and MERF algorithms and compared them to traditional linear mixed models (LMMs)
predicting depressive symptoms prospectively and concurrently with
cross-validation. Results: Our results indicated that the RE-EM tree and MERF
methods model complex interactions, identify subgroups of individuals and
predict depression severity comparable to LMM. Further, machine learning models
determined that brooding, negative life events, negative cognitive styles, and
perceived control were the most relevant predictors of future depression
levels. Conclusions: Random effects machine learning models have the potential

Depression can cause serious emotional, behavioural and physical health
problems with significant consequences, both personal and social costs
included. This paper studies community depression dynamics due to COVID-19
pandemic through user-generated content on Twitter. A new approach based on
multi-modal features from tweets and Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency
(TF-IDF) is proposed to build depression classification models. Multi-modal
features capture depression cues from emotion, topic and domain-specific
perspectives. We study the problem using recently scraped tweets from Twitter
users emanating from the state of New South Wales in Australia. Our novel
classification model is capable of extracting depression polarities which may
be affected by COVID-19 and related events during the COVID-19 period. The
results found that people became more depressed after the outbreak of COVID-19.
The measures implemented by the government such as the state lockdown also
increased depression levels. Further analysis in the Local Government Area
(LGA) level found that the community depression level was different across
different LGAs. Such granular level analysis of depression dynamics not only
can help authorities such as governmental departments to take corresponding

depression,"Exploring Musical, Lyrical, and Network Dimensions of Music Sharing
  Among Depression Individuals","['Qihan Wang', 'Anique Tahir', 'Zeyad Alghamdi', 'Huan Liu']","Depression has emerged as a significant mental health concern due to a
variety of factors, reflecting broader societal and individual challenges.
Within the digital era, social media has become an important platform for
individuals navigating through depression, enabling them to express their
emotional and mental states through various mediums, notably music.
Specifically, their music preferences, manifested through sharing practices,
inadvertently offer a glimpse into their psychological and emotional
landscapes. This work seeks to study the differences in music preferences
between individuals diagnosed with depression and non-diagnosed individuals,
exploring numerous facets of music, including musical features, lyrics, and
musical networks. The music preferences of individuals with depression through
music sharing on social media, reveal notable differences in musical features
and topics and language use of lyrics compared to non-depressed individuals. We
find the network information enhances understanding of the link between music
listening patterns. The result highlights a potential echo-chamber effect,
where depression individual's musical choices may inadvertently perpetuate
depressive moods and emotions. In sum, this study underscores the significance
of examining music's various aspects to grasp its relationship with mental
health, offering insights for personalized music interventions and
recommendation algorithms that could benefit individuals with depression.",2023,http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11557v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.11557v1

  Disorder","['Dolcy Dhar', 'Manasi Chaturvedi', 'Saanvi Sehwag', 'Chehak Malhotra', 'Udit', 'Chetan Saraf', 'Mrinmoy Chakrabarty']","Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) involves diverse neurodevelopmental syndromes
with significant deficits in communication, motor behaviours, emotional and
social comprehension. Often, individuals with ASD exhibit comorbid conditions,
one of the most prevalent being depression characterized by a persistent change
in mood and diminished interest in previously enjoyable activities. Due to
communicative challenges and lack of appropriate assessments in individuals
with ASD, comorbid depression can often go undiagnosed during routine clinical
examinations, which may aggravate their problems. The current literature on
comorbid depression in adults with ASD is limited. Therefore, understanding the
neural basis of the comorbid psychopathology of depression in ASD is crucial
for identifying objective brain-based markers for its timely and effective
management. Towards this end, using structural MRI and phenotypic data from the
Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange II (ABIDE II) repository, we specifically
examined the pattern of relationship regional grey matter volume (rGMV) has
with comorbid depression and autism severity within regions of a priori
interest in adults with ASD (n = 44). The severity of comorbid depression
correlated negatively with the rGMV of the right thalamus. Additionally, a
significant interaction was evident between the severity of comorbid depression
and core ASD symptoms towards explaining the rGMV in the left cerebellum crus
II. The whole-brain regional rGMV differences between ASD and typically
developed (TD, n = 39) adults remained inconclusive. The results further the
understanding of the neurobiological underpinnings of comorbid depression in

  Anxiety","['Sharath Chandra Guntuku', 'Daniel Preotiuc-Pietro', 'Johannes C. Eichstaedt', 'Lyle H. Ungar']","Previous work has found strong links between the choice of social media
images and users' emotions, demographics and personality traits. In this study,
we examine which attributes of profile and posted images are associated with
depression and anxiety of Twitter users. We used a sample of 28,749 Facebook
users to build a language prediction model of survey-reported depression and
anxiety, and validated it on Twitter on a sample of 887 users who had taken
anxiety and depression surveys. We then applied it to a different set of 4,132
Twitter users to impute language-based depression and anxiety labels, and
extracted interpretable features of posted and profile pictures to uncover the
associations with users' depression and anxiety, controlling for demographics.
For depression, we find that profile pictures suppress positive emotions rather
than display more negative emotions, likely because of social media
self-presentation biases. They also tend to show the single face of the user
(rather than show her in groups of friends), marking increased focus on the
self, emblematic for depression. Posted images are dominated by grayscale and
low aesthetic cohesion across a variety of image features. Profile images of
anxious users are similarly marked by grayscale and low aesthetic cohesion, but
less so than those of depressed users. Finally, we show that image features can
be used to predict depression and anxiety, and that multitask learning that
includes a joint modeling of demographics improves prediction performance.
Overall, we find that the image attributes that mark depression and anxiety
offer a rich lens into these conditions largely congruent with the
psychological literature, and that images on Twitter allow inferences about the
mental health status of users.",2019,http://arxiv.org/abs/1904.02670v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.02670v1

Many other barriers also hinder depression detection and treatment in PHC.
Artificial intelligence (AI) may help reduce depression misdiagnosis in PHC and
improve overall diagnosis and treatment outcomes. Telehealth consultations
often have video issues, such as poor connectivity or dropped calls. Audio-only
telehealth is often more practical for lower-income patients who may lack
stable internet connections. Thus, our study focused on using audio data to
predict depression risk. The objectives were to: 1) Collect audio data from 24
people (12 with depression and 12 without mental health or major health

algorithm, which was the K-nearest neighbors classifier. The selected model had
high performance in classifying depression risk (Precision: 0.98, Recall: 0.93,

detect depression signals from social media posts have shown promising results.
Given the high internal validity, results from such analyses are potentially
beneficial to clinical judgment. The existing models for automatic detection of
depressive symptoms learn proxy diagnostic signals from social media data, such
as help-seeking behavior for mental health or medication names. However, in
reality, individuals with depression typically experience depressed mood, loss
of pleasure nearly in all the activities, feeling of worthlessness or guilt,
and diminished ability to think. Therefore, a lot of the proxy signals used in
these models lack the theoretical underpinnings for depressive symptoms. It is
also reported that social media posts from many patients in the clinical

monitor a type of signal that is well-established as a class of symptoms in

computational power, information theory, complex systems dynamics, and
nonlinear analysis applied to physiological complexity, we can now turn to
novel biomarkers extracted from electrophysiological signals. This work is a
cross-sectional analysis with methodological commentary of application of
nonlinear measures of HRV related to depression. Methods: We systematically
searched online for papers exploring the connection of depression and HRV,

Sixty-seven publications on the connection of HRV measures and depression
meeting our inclusion criteria are selected. The effectiveness of the applied
methods of electrocardiogram (ECG) analysis are compared and discussed in the

the functional roles is to enlarge basins of attraction. To verify this
hypothesis, we employ a binary discrete-time associative memory model which

excitatory-inhibitory balance controls an overall activity of the network. The
synaptic depression might incorporate an activity control mechanism. Using a
mean-field theory and computer simulations, we find that the basins of

depression driven switching can be approximated using a separation of
timescales in the ring and space-free model. For purely noise-driven switching,
we use energy arguments to justify how dominance times are exponentially

there is little difference between their dynamics. Recent physiological
experiments have shown that short-term dynamic synapse called synaptic
depression decreases its transmission efficacy to postsynaptic neurons

depression,Keynesian models of depression. Supply shocks and the COVID-19 Crisis,['Ignacio Escanuela Romana'],"The objective of this work is twofold: to expand the depression models
proposed by Tobin and analyse a supply shock, such as the Covid-19 pandemic, in
this Keynesian conceptual environment. The expansion allows us to propose the
evolution of all endogenous macroeconomic variables. The result obtained is
relevant due to its theoretical and practical implications. A quantity or
Keynesian adjustment to the shock produces a depression through the effect on
aggregate demand. This depression worsens in the medium/long-term. It is
accompanied by increases in inflation, inflation expectations and the real
interest rate. A stimulus tax policy is also recommended, as well as an active
monetary policy to reduce real interest rates. On the other hand, the pricing
or Marshallian adjustment foresees a more severe and rapid depression in the
short-term. There would be a reduction in inflation and inflation expectations,
and an increase in the real interest rates. The tax or monetary stimulus
measures would only impact inflation. This result makes it possible to clarify
and assess the resulting depression, as well as propose policies. Finally, it
offers conflicting predictions that allow one of the two models to be
falsified.",2020,http://arxiv.org/abs/2007.07353v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.07353v2

depression automatically from some medical records, like video sequences.
However, it remains challenging to effectively extract depression-specific

the Feature-Wise Attention (FWA) module is adopted to fuse different features
extracted from TDCNs. The module learns to assign weights for the feature

low-amplitude dipole modes, which are referred to as depressed modes. Recently,
these low amplitudes have been attributed to the presence of a strong magnetic
field in the stellar core of those stars.
  We intend to study the properties of depressed modes in evolved stars, which
is a necessary condition before concluding on the physical nature of the
mechanism responsible for the reduction of the dipole mode amplitudes.
  We perform a thorough characterization of the global seismic parameters of
depressed dipole modes and show that these modes have a mixed character. The
observation of stars showing dipole mixed modes that are depressed is
especially useful for deriving model-independent conclusions on the dipole mode
damping.
  Observations prove that depressed dipole modes in red giants are not pure
pressure modes but mixed modes. This result invalidates the hypothesis that the
depressed dipole modes result from the suppression of the oscillation in the
radiative core of the stars. Observations also show that, except for the
visibility, the seismic properties of the stars with depressed modes are
equivalent to those of normal stars.
  The mixed nature of the depressed modes in red giants and their unperturbed
global seismic parameters carry strong constraints on the physical mechanism
responsible for the damping of the oscillation in the core. This mechanism is
able to damp the oscillation in the core but cannot fully suppress it.
Moreover, it cannot modify the radiative cavity probed by the gravity component
of the mixed modes. The recent mechanism involving high magnetic field proposed
for explaining depressed modes is not compliant with the observations and
cannot be used to infer the strength and the prevalence of high magnetic fields

  condition of the magnetic field vector","['B. Löptien', 'A. Lagg', 'M. van Noort', 'S. K. Solanki']","Context: The Wilson depression is the difference in geometric height of unit
continuum optical depth between the sunspot umbra and the quiet Sun. Measuring
the Wilson depression is important for understanding the geometry of sunspots.
Current methods suffer from systematic effects or need to make assumptions on
the geometry of the magnetic field. This leads to large systematic
uncertainties of the derived Wilson depressions.
  Aims: We aim at developing a robust method for deriving the Wilson depression
that only requires the information about the magnetic field that is accessible
from spectropolarimetry, and that does not rely on assumptions on the geometry
of sunspots or on their magnetic field.
  Methods: Our method is based on minimizing the divergence of the magnetic
field vector derived from spectropolarimetric observations. We focus on large
spatial scales only in order to reduce the number of free parameters.
  Results: We test the performance of our method using synthetic Hinode data
derived from two sunspot simulations. We find that the maximum and the umbral
averaged Wilson depression for both spots determined with our method typically
lies within 100 km of the true value obtained from the simulations. In
addition, we apply the method to Hinode observations of a sunspot. The derived
Wilson depression (about 600 km) is consistent with results typically obtained
from the Wilson effect. We also find that the Wilson depression obtained from
using horizontal force balance gives 110 - 180 km smaller Wilson depressions
than both, what we find and what we deduce directly from the simulations. This
suggests that the magnetic pressure and the magnetic curvature force contribute
to the Wilson depression by a similar amount.",2018,http://arxiv.org/abs/1808.06867v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1808.06867v1

is depressed compared to the quiet Sun. This so-called Wilson depression is
caused by the Lorentz force of the strong magnetic field inside the spots.
However, it is not understood in detail yet, how the Wilson depression is
related to the strength and geometry of the magnetic field or to other
properties of the sunspot.
  Aims: We aim to study the dependence of the Wilson depression on the
properties of the magnetic field of the sunspots and how exactly the magnetic
field contributes to balancing the Wilson depression with respect to the gas
pressure of the surroundings of the spots.
  Methods: Our study is based on 24 spectropolarimetric scans of 12 individual
sunspots performed with Hinode. We derived the Wilson depression for each spot
using both, a recently developed method that is based on minimizing the
divergence of the magnetic field, and an approach developed earlier that
enforces an equilibrium between the gas pressure and the magnetic pressure
inside the spot and the gas pressure in the quiet Sun, thus neglecting the
influence of the curvature force. We then performed a statistical analysis by
comparing the Wilson depression resulting from the two techniques with each
other and by relating them to various parameters of the sunspots, such as their
size or the strength of the magnetic field.
  Results: We find that the Wilson depression becomes larger for spots with a
stronger magnetic field, but not as much as one would expect from the increased
magnetic pressure. This suggests that the curvature integral provides an
important contribution to the Wilson depression, particularly for spots with a
weak magnetic field. Our results indicate that the geometry of the magnetic
field in the penumbra is different between spots with different strengths of
the average umbral magnetic field.",2020,http://arxiv.org/abs/2002.07484v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2002.07484v1

classical antidepressant has no proven efficacy on this type of distress
compared to placebo. A Psilocybin (serotoninergic hallucinogen) based therapy
appear to give promising results among recent studies. Aims : to examine if a
Psilocybin based therapy could be considered for patients with cancer related
depression and anxiety and to assume it's safety. To sum up Heffter institute
work, as the main institute working on this topic. Method : following PRISMA
(Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta Analyses)
guidelines, a systematic review was conducted, for quantitative and qualitative
studies about psilocybin for treating cancer related depression and anxiety.
Pubmed and the Heffter institute databases have been reached for this purpose,
separating studies in types : qualitative or quantitative. We studied the
effects on cancer related depression and anxiety separately and investigated
the psychological and neurobiological mechanisms. Results : the four studies
included a total of 105 randomized patients, meta analysis on depression and
anxiety with pooled Peto odds ratio showed a significant superiority of
Psilocybin over placebo. The substance appeared to be safe for this type of
patients. Surprising psychological mechanisms hypothesis have been found out.
Conclusion : psilocybin appear to be potentially useful as a treatment for
cancer related depression and anxiety. Future research should verify these
findings on wider population and eventually seek a way to apply therapy to non
hospitalized (ambulatory) patients. Keywords : psilocybin, depression, anxiety,

achieves comparable results with the diagnostic task, which indicates the
possibility of forecasting depression from mobile phone sensor data. Our model

  Via Speaker Disentanglement","['Vijay Ravi', 'Jinhan Wang', 'Jonathan Flint', 'Abeer Alwan']","Preserving a patient's identity is a challenge for automatic, speech-based
diagnosis of mental health disorders. In this paper, we address this issue by
proposing adversarial disentanglement of depression characteristics and speaker
identity. The model used for depression classification is trained in a
speaker-identity-invariant manner by minimizing depression prediction loss and
maximizing speaker prediction loss during training. The effectiveness of the
proposed method is demonstrated on two datasets - DAIC-WOZ (English) and
CONVERGE (Mandarin), with three feature sets (Mel-spectrograms, raw-audio
signals, and the last-hidden-state of Wav2vec2.0), using a modified DepAudioNet
model. With adversarial training, depression classification improves for every
feature when compared to the baseline. Wav2vec2.0 features with adversarial
learning resulted in the best performance (F1-score of 69.2% for DAIC-WOZ and
91.5% for CONVERGE). Analysis of the class-separability measure (J-ratio) of
the hidden states of the DepAudioNet model shows that when adversarial learning
is applied, the backend model loses some speaker-discriminability while it
improves depression-discriminability. These results indicate that there are
some components of speaker identity that may not be useful for depression
detection and minimizing their effects provides a more accurate diagnosis of
the underlying disorder and can safeguard a speaker's identity.",2022,http://arxiv.org/abs/2206.09530v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.09530v2

second one on the opposite side of the cliff. The largest depression (structure

by the sublimation of ices, which explains their global growth and which can
also trigger landslides. The deposits associated with depression II reveal a
stair-like topography, indicating that they have accumulated during several

  Depression","['Suhas BN', 'Saeed Abdullah']","Recent studies have used speech signals to assess depression. However, speech
features can lead to serious privacy concerns. To address these concerns, prior
work has used privacy-preserving speech features. However, using a subset of
features can lead to information loss and, consequently, non-optimal model
performance. Furthermore, prior work relies on a centralized approach to
support continuous model updates, posing privacy risks. This paper proposes to
use Federated Learning (FL) to enable decentralized, privacy-preserving speech
analysis to assess depression. Using an existing dataset (DAIC-WOZ), we show
that FL models enable a robust assessment of depression with only 4--6%
accuracy loss compared to a centralized approach. These models also outperform
prior work using the same dataset. Furthermore, the FL models have short
inference latency and small memory footprints while being energy-efficient.
These models, thus, can be deployed on mobile devices for real-time,
continuous, and privacy-preserving depression assessment at scale.",2022,http://arxiv.org/abs/2205.00111v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.00111v2

depressions. Such regions are bounded areas of the search space in which the
heuristic function is inaccurate compared to the actual cost to reach a
solution. Early real-time search algorithms, like LRTA*, easily become trapped
in those regions since the heuristic values of their states may need to be
updated multiple times, which results in costly solutions. State-of-the-art
real-time search algorithms, like LSS-LRTA* or LRTA*(k), improve LRTA*s
mechanism to update the heuristic, resulting in improved performance. Those
algorithms, however, do not guide search towards avoiding depressed regions.
This paper presents depression avoidance, a simple real-time search principle
to guide search towards avoiding states that have been marked as part of a
heuristic depression. We propose two ways in which depression avoidance can be
implemented: mark-and-avoid and move-to-border. We implement these strategies
on top of LSS-LRTA* and RTAA*, producing 4 new real-time heuristic search

show that daLSS-LRTA* and daRTAA* outperform their predecessors sometimes by
one order of magnitude. Of the four new algorithms, daRTAA* produces the best

depression,A blue depression in the optical spectra of M dwarfs,"['Hugh R. A. Jones', 'Yakiv Pavlenko', 'Yuri Lyubchik', 'Mike Bessell', 'Nicole Allard', 'David J. Pinfield']","A blue depression is found in the spectra of M dwarfs from 4000 to 4500A.
This depression shows an increase toward lower temperatures though is
particularly sensitive to gravity and metallicity. It is the single most
sensitive feature in the optical spectra of M dwarfs. The depression appears as
centered on the neutral calcium resonance line at 4227A and leads to nearby
features being weaker by about two orders of magnitude than predicted. We
consider a variety of possible causes for the depression including temperature,
gravity, metallicity, dust, damping constants, and atmospheric stratification.
We also consider relevant molecular opacities which might be the cause
identifying AlH, SiH, and NaH in the spectral region. However, none of these
solutions are satisfactory. In the absence of a more accurate determination of
the broadening of the calcium line perturbed by molecular hydrogen, we find a
promising empirical fit using a modified Lorentzian line profile for the
calcium resonance line. Such fits provide a simplistic line-broadening
description for this calcium resonance line and potentially other un-modelled
resonance lines in cool high-pressure atmospheres. Thus we claim the most
plausible cause of the blue depression in the optical spectra of M dwarfs is a
lack of appropriate treatment of line broadening for atomic calcium. The broad
wings of the calcium resonance line develop at temperatures below about 4000K
and are analogous to the neutral sodium and potassium features which dominate
the red optical spectra of L dwarfs.",2023,http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.09219v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.09219v2

  Transformer","['Ai-Te Kuo', 'Haiquan Chen', 'Yu-Hsuan Kuo', 'Wei-Shinn Ku']","Early detection of mental disorder is crucial as it enables prompt
intervention and treatment, which can greatly improve outcomes for individuals
suffering from debilitating mental affliction. The recent proliferation of
mental health discussions on social media platforms presents research
opportunities to investigate mental health and potentially detect instances of
mental illness. However, existing depression detection methods are constrained
due to two major limitations: (1) the reliance on feature engineering and (2)
the lack of consideration for time-varying factors. Specifically, these methods
require extensive feature engineering and domain knowledge, which heavily rely
on the amount, quality, and type of user-generated content. Moreover, these
methods ignore the important impact of time-varying factors on depression
detection, such as the dynamics of linguistic patterns and interpersonal
interactive behaviors over time on social media (e.g., replies, mentions, and
quote-tweets). To tackle these limitations, we propose an early depression
detection framework, ContrastEgo treats each user as a dynamic time-evolving
attributed graph (ego-network) and leverages supervised contrastive learning to
maximize the agreement of users' representations at different scales while
minimizing the agreement of users' representations to differentiate between
depressed and control groups. ContrastEgo embraces four modules, (1)
constructing users' heterogeneous interactive graphs, (2) extracting the
representations of users' interaction snapshots using graph neural networks,
(3) modeling the sequences of snapshots using attention mechanism, and (4)
depression detection using contrastive learning. Extensive experiments on

  Algorithm for Digital Elevation Models","['Richard Barnes', 'Clarence Lehman', 'David Mulla']","Depressions (or pits) are low areas within a digital elevation model that are
surrounded by higher terrain, with no outlet to lower areas. Filling them so
they are level, as fluid would fill them if the terrain were impermeable, is
often necessary in preprocessing DEMs. The depression-filling algorithm
presented here---called Priority-Flood---unifies and improves on the work of a
number of previous authors who have published similar algorithms. The algorithm
operates by flooding DEMs inwards from their edges using a priority queue to
determine the next cell to be flooded. The resultant DEM has no depressions or
digital dams: every cell is guaranteed to drain. The algorithm is optimal for
both integer and floating-point data, working in O(n) and O(n lg n) time,
respectively. It is shown that by using a plain queue to fill depressions once
they have been found, an O(m lg m) time-complexity can be achieved, where m
does not exceed the number of cells n. This is the lowest time complexity of
any known floating-point depression-filling algorithm. In testing, this
improved variation of the algorithm performed up to 37% faster than the
original. Additionally, a parallel version of an older, but widely-used
depression-filling algorithm required six parallel processors to achieve a
run-time on par with what the newer algorithm's improved variation took on a
single processor. The Priority-Flood Algorithm is simple to understand and
implement: the included pseudocode is only 20 lines and the included C++
reference implementation is under a hundred lines. The algorithm can work on
irregular meshes as well as 4-, 6-, 8-, and n-connected grids. It can also be
adapted to label watersheds and determine flow directions through either
incremental elevation changes or depression carving. In the case of incremental
elevation changes, the algorithm includes safety checks not present in prior

platforms (e.g., Reddit) to express their difficulties and health issues (e.g.,
depression) and seek support from other users in online communities. It opens
great opportunities to automatically identify social media users with
depression by parsing millions of posts for potential interventions. Deep
learning methods have begun to dominate in the field of machine learning and
natural language processing (NLP) because of their ease of use, efficient
processing, and state-of-the-art results on many NLP tasks. In this work, we
propose a hybrid deep learning model which combines a pretrained sentence BERT

depression with their Reddit posts. The sentence BERT is used to learn the
meaningful representation of semantic information in each post. CNN enables the
further transformation of those embeddings and the temporal identification of
behavioral patterns of users. We trained and evaluated the model performance to
identify Reddit users with depression by utilizing the Self-reported Mental
Health Diagnoses (SMHD) data. The hybrid deep learning model achieved an
accuracy of 0.86 and an F1 score of 0.86 and outperformed the state-of-the-art

aimed to explore associations between depression symptom severity and
daily-life gait characteristics derived from acceleration signals in real-world

71 elder adults' 3-day acceleration signals collected by a wearable device, and
a subset of an EU longitudinal depression study with 215 participants and their
phone-collected acceleration signals (average 463 hours per participant). We
detected participants' gait cycles and force from acceleration signals and
extracted 20 statistics-based daily-life gait features to describe the
distribution and variance of gait cadence and force over a long-term period
corresponding to the self-reported depression score. The gait cadence of faster
steps (75th percentile) over a long-term period has a significant negative
association with the depression symptom severity of this period in both

fit of evaluating depression severity relative to laboratory gait patterns and
demographics, which was assessed by likelihood-ratio tests in both datasets.
This study indicated that the significant links between daily-life walking

transforms continuously from a soliton array to a sinusoidal pattern as the
period becomes smaller than the soliton width. These patterns become unstable

depression is a longer term mental illness which impairs social, occupational,

novel dataset illustrating the difference between the two. In this paper, we
aim to highlight the difference between the two and highlight how interpretable
our models are to distinctly label sadness and depression. Due to the sensitive

  mimics: Surface tension depression and secondary organic products","['Zhi Li', 'Allison N. Schwier', 'Neha Sareen', 'V. Faye McNeill']","The reactive uptake of carbonyl-containing volatile organic compounds (cVOCs)
by aqueous atmospheric aerosols is a likely source of particulate organic
material. The aqueous-phase secondary organic products of some cVOCs are
surface-active. Therefore, cVOC uptake can lead to organic film formation at
the gas-aerosol interface and changes in aerosol surface tension. We examined
the chemical reactions of two abundant cVOCs, formaldehyde and acetaldehyde, in
water and aqueous ammonium sulfate (AS) solutions mimicking tropospheric
aerosols. Secondary organic products were identified using Aerosol Chemical
Ionization Mass Spectrometry (Aerosol-CIMS), and changes in surface tension
were monitored using pendant drop tensiometry. Hemiacetal oligomers and aldol
condensation products were identified using Aerosol-CIMS. Acetaldehyde
depresses surface tension to 65(\pm2) dyn/cm in pure water (a 10% surface
tension reduction from that of pure water) and 62(\pm1) dyn/cm in AS solutions
(a 20.6% reduction from that of a 3.1 M AS solution). Surface tension
depression by formaldehyde in pure water is negligible; in AS solutions, a 9%
reduction in surface tension is observed. Mixtures of these species were also
studied in combination with methylglyoxal in order to evaluate the influence of
cross-reactions on surface tension depression and product formation in these
systems. We find that surface tension depression in the solutions containing
mixed cVOCs exceeds that predicted by an additive model based on the
single-species isotherms.",2011,http://arxiv.org/abs/1106.3015v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1106.3015v3

  Short- and Long-term Plastic Synapses","['Eleni Vasilaki', 'Michele Giugliano']","Recent evidence in rodent cerebral cortex and olfactory bulb suggests that
short-term dynamics of excitatory synaptic transmission is correlated to
stereotypical connectivity motifs. It was observed that neurons with short-term
facilitating synapses form predominantly reciprocal pairwise connections, while
neurons with short-term depressing synapses form unidirectional pairwise
connections. The cause of these structural differences in synaptic
microcircuits is unknown. We propose that these connectivity motifs emerge from
the interactions between short-term synaptic dynamics (SD) and long-term
spike-timing dependent plasticity (STDP). While the impact of STDP on SD was
shown in vitro, the mutual interactions between STDP and SD in large networks
are still the subject of intense research. We formulate a computational model
by combining SD and STDP, which captures faithfully short- and long-term
dependence on both spike times and frequency. As a proof of concept, we
simulate recurrent networks of spiking neurons with random initial connection
efficacies and where synapses are either all short-term facilitating or all
depressing. For identical background inputs, and as a direct consequence of
internally generated activity, we find that networks with depressing synapses
evolve unidirectional connectivity motifs, while networks with facilitating
synapses evolve reciprocal connectivity motifs. This holds for heterogeneous
networks including both facilitating and depressing synapses. Our study
highlights the conditions under which SD-STDP might the correlation between
facilitation and reciprocal connectivity motifs, as well as between depression
and unidirectional motifs. We further suggest experiments for the validation of
the proposed mechanism.",2013,http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.7187v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1301.7187v1

backward elimination using Cox proportional hazards model was performed to
select predictors which account for the majority of its predictive capability.
Baseline and reduced models were then trained for depression and anxiety using
both Cox and DeepSurv, a deep neural network approach to survival analysis. The
baseline Cox model achieved concordance of 0.813 and 0.778 on the validation
dataset for depression and anxiety, respectively. For the DeepSurv model,
respective concordance indices were 0.805 and 0.774. After feature selection,
the depression model contained 43 predictors and the concordance index was
0.801 for both Cox and DeepSurv. The reduced anxiety model, with 27 predictors,
achieved concordance of 0.770 in both models. The final models showed good
discrimination and calibration in the test datasets.We developed predictive
risk scores with high discrimination for depression and anxiety using the UKB
cohort, incorporating predictors which are easily obtainable via smartphone. If
deployed in a digital solution, it would allow individuals to track their risk,

  Anxiety Based on Social Media Data","['Shoffan Saifullah', 'Yuli Fauziah', 'Agus Sasmito Aribowo']","All groups of people felt the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. This situation
triggers anxiety, which is bad for everyone. The government's role is very
influential in solving these problems with its work program. It also has many
pros and cons that cause public anxiety. For that, it is necessary to detect
anxiety to improve government programs that can increase public expectations.
This study applies machine learning to detecting anxiety based on social media
comments regarding government programs to deal with this pandemic. This concept
will adopt a sentiment analysis in detecting anxiety based on positive and
negative comments from netizens. The machine learning methods implemented
include K-NN, Bernoulli, Decision Tree Classifier, Support Vector Classifier,
Random Forest, and XG-boost. The data sample used is the result of crawling
YouTube comments. The data used amounted to 4862 comments consisting of
negative and positive data with 3211 and 1651. Negative data identify anxiety,
while positive data identifies hope (not anxious). Machine learning is
processed based on feature extraction of count-vectorization and TF-IDF. The
results showed that the sentiment data amounted to 3889 and 973 in testing, and
training with the greatest accuracy was the random forest with feature
extraction of vectorization count and TF-IDF of 84.99% and 82.63%,
respectively. The best precision test is K-NN, while the best recall is
XG-Boost. Thus, Random Forest is the best accurate to detect someone's anxiety

anxiety,"Network psychometrics and cognitive network science open new ways for
  detecting, understanding and tackling the complexity of math anxiety: A
  review",['Massimo Stella'],"Math anxiety is a clinical pathology impairing cognitive processing in
math-related contexts. Originally thought to affect only inexperienced,
low-achieving students, recent investigations show how math anxiety is vastly
diffused even among high-performing learners. This review of data-informed
studies outlines math anxiety as a complex system that: (i) cripples
well-being, self-confidence and information processing on both conscious and
subconscious levels, (ii) can be transmitted by social interactions, like a
pathogen, and worsened by distorted perceptions, (iii) affects roughly 20% of
students in 63 out of 64 worldwide educational systems but correlates weakly
with academic performance, and (iv) poses a concrete threat to students'
well-being, computational literacy and career prospects in science. These
patterns underline the crucial need to go beyond performance for estimating
math anxiety. Recent advances with network psychometrics and cognitive network
science provide ideal frameworks for detecting, interpreting and intervening
upon such clinical condition. Merging education research, psychology and data
science, the approaches reviewed here reconstruct psychological constructs as
complex systems, represented either as multivariate correlation models (e.g.
graph exploratory analysis) or as cognitive networks of semantic/emotional
associations (e.g. free association networks or forma mentis networks). Not
only can these interconnected networks detect otherwise hidden levels of math
anxiety but - more crucially - they can unveil the specific layout of
interacting factors, e.g. key sources and targets, behind math anxiety in a
given cohort. As discussed here, these network approaches open concrete ways
for unveiling students' perceptions, emotions and mental well-being, and can
enable future powerful data-informed interventions untangling math anxiety.",2021,http://arxiv.org/abs/2108.13800v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.13800v1

  Sensors and Context Feature","['Rajdeep Kumar Nath', 'Himanshu Thapliyal']","This paper explores a novel method for anxiety detection in older adults
using simple wristband sensors such as Electrodermal Activity (EDA) and
Photoplethysmogram (PPG) and a context-based feature. The proposed method for
anxiety detection combines features from a single physiological signal with an
experimental context-based feature to improve the performance of the anxiety
detection model. The experimental data for this work is obtained from a
year-long experiment on 41 healthy older adults (26 females and 15 males) in
the age range 60-80 with mean age 73.36+-5.25 during a Trier Social Stress Test
(TSST) protocol. The anxiety level ground truth was obtained from State-Trait
Anxiety Inventory (STAI), which is regarded as the gold standard to measure
perceived anxiety. EDA and Blood Volume Pulse (BVP) signals were recorded using
a wrist-worn EDA and PPG sensor respectively. 47 features were computed from
EDA and BVP signal, out of which a final set of 24 significantly correlated
features were selected for analysis. The phases of the experimental study are
encoded as unique integers to generate the context feature vector. A
combination of features from a single sensor with the context feature vector is
used for training a machine learning model to distinguish between anxious and
not-anxious states. Results and analysis showed that the EDA and BVP machine
learning models that combined the context feature along with the physiological
features achieved 3.37% and 6.41% higher accuracy respectively than the models
that used only physiological features. Further, end-to-end processing of EDA
and BVP signals was simulated for real-time anxiety level detection. This work
demonstrates the practicality of the proposed anxiety detection method in
facilitating long-term monitoring of anxiety in older adults using low-cost

relevance. We propose to turn the lens of psychiatry, a framework used to

using anxiety-inducing prompts. Anxiety-induction not only influences LLMs'
scores on an anxiety questionnaire but also influences their behavior in a
previously-established benchmark measuring biases such as racism and ageism.
Importantly, greater anxiety-inducing text leads to stronger increases in
biases, suggesting that how anxiously a prompt is communicated to large

danger, but is susceptible to dysregulation. Anxiety disorders are prevalent at
high frequency in contemporary human societies, yet impose substantial
disability upon their sufferers. This raises a puzzle: why has evolution left
us vulnerable to anxiety disorders? We develop a signal detection model in
which individuals must learn how to calibrate their anxiety responses: they
need to learn which cues indicate danger in the environment. We derive the
optimal strategy for doing so, and find that individuals face an inevitable
exploration-exploitation tradeoff between obtaining a better estimate of the
level of risk on one hand, and maximizing current payoffs on the other. Because
of this tradeoff, a subset of the population can become trapped in a state of
self-perpetuating over-sensitivity to threatening stimuli, even when
individuals learn optimally. This phenomenon arises because when individuals
become too cautious, they stop sampling the environment and fail to correct
their misperceptions, whereas when individuals become too careless they
continue to sample the environment and soon discover their mistakes. Thus,
over-sensitivity to threats becomes common whereas under-sensitivity becomes
rare. We suggest that this process may be involved in the development of

  patients and hospital staff","['Atieh Sadeghniiat-Haghighi', 'Arezu Najafi', 'Khosro Sadeghniiat Haghighi', 'Arghavan Shafiee-Aghdam', 'Farzan Vahedifard', 'Fatemeh Hoshyar Zare', 'Maryam Tolouei Shivyari', 'Mohammad Tolouei']","Introduction: The global COVID-19 pandemic has heightened stress, anxiety,
and sadness, leading to increased rates of insomnia (6-10%). This study
explores the effectiveness of supportive psychotherapy, specifically
Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia (CBT-I), in managing COVID-19-induced
insomnia among patients and hospital staff.
  Method: A before-and-after design assessed the impact of supportive care by a
psychiatrist on anxiety and insomnia in 18 hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Four
CBT-I sessions (20 minutes to an hour each) were administered. Baseline
assessments included sleep efficiency, insomnia severity, and generalized
anxiety disorder symptoms. Statistical analyses, including paired t-tests,
McNemar tests, and regression models using IBM SPSS Statistics, were employed.
  Results: Supportive psychotherapy significantly improved outcomes in
patients. Anxiety levels decreased (mean score: 4.49 to 2.65, p = 0.038), and
insomnia severity scores decreased across all three items. Sleep quality
improved (mean score: 6.44 to 8.55, p = 0.005). Staff members also experienced
positive outcomes, with significant reductions in anxiety (mean score: 3.88 to
2.6, p = 0.037) and improvements in insomnia severity. Sleep quality showed
improvement but did not reach statistical significance (p = 0.08).
  Conclusion: Supportive psychotherapy, particularly CBT-I, effectively reduces
anxiety, improves insomnia symptoms, and enhances sleep quality in patients and
staff. This approach proves valuable for managing COVID-19-induced insomnia.
Larger-scale research is necessary to validate and generalize these outcomes,
emphasizing the importance of CBT-I for individuals affected by the pandemic.",2023,http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09561v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.09561v1

  Anxiety","['Sharath Chandra Guntuku', 'Daniel Preotiuc-Pietro', 'Johannes C. Eichstaedt', 'Lyle H. Ungar']","Previous work has found strong links between the choice of social media
images and users' emotions, demographics and personality traits. In this study,
we examine which attributes of profile and posted images are associated with
depression and anxiety of Twitter users. We used a sample of 28,749 Facebook
users to build a language prediction model of survey-reported depression and
anxiety, and validated it on Twitter on a sample of 887 users who had taken
anxiety and depression surveys. We then applied it to a different set of 4,132
Twitter users to impute language-based depression and anxiety labels, and
extracted interpretable features of posted and profile pictures to uncover the
associations with users' depression and anxiety, controlling for demographics.
For depression, we find that profile pictures suppress positive emotions rather
than display more negative emotions, likely because of social media
self-presentation biases. They also tend to show the single face of the user
(rather than show her in groups of friends), marking increased focus on the
self, emblematic for depression. Posted images are dominated by grayscale and
low aesthetic cohesion across a variety of image features. Profile images of
anxious users are similarly marked by grayscale and low aesthetic cohesion, but
less so than those of depressed users. Finally, we show that image features can
be used to predict depression and anxiety, and that multitask learning that
includes a joint modeling of demographics improves prediction performance.
Overall, we find that the image attributes that mark depression and anxiety
offer a rich lens into these conditions largely congruent with the
psychological literature, and that images on Twitter allow inferences about the
mental health status of users.",2019,http://arxiv.org/abs/1904.02670v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.02670v1
anxiety,When to sell an asset amid anxiety about drawdowns,"['Neofytos Rodosthenous', 'Hongzhong Zhang']","We consider risk averse investors with different levels of anxiety about
asset price drawdowns. The latter is defined as the distance of the current
price away from its best performance since inception. These drawdowns can
increase either continuously or by jumps, and will contribute towards the
investor's overall impatience when breaching the investor's private tolerance
level. We investigate the unusual reactions of investors when aiming to sell an
asset under such adverse market conditions. Mathematically, we study the
optimal stopping of the utility of an asset sale with a random discounting that
captures the investor's overall impatience. The random discounting is given by
the cumulative amount of time spent by the drawdowns in an undesirable high
region, fine tuned by the investor's personal tolerance and anxiety about
drawdowns. We prove that in addition to the traditional take-profit sales, the
real-life employed stop-loss orders and trailing stops may become part of the
optimal selling strategy, depending on different personal characteristics. This
paper thus provides insights on the effect of anxiety and its distinction with
traditional risk aversion on decision making.",2020,http://arxiv.org/abs/2006.00282v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.00282v1

anxiety,Towards Preemptive Detection of Depression and Anxiety in Twitter,"['David Owen', 'Jose Camacho Collados', 'Luis Espinosa-Anke']","Depression and anxiety are psychiatric disorders that are observed in many
areas of everyday life. For example, these disorders manifest themselves
somewhat frequently in texts written by nondiagnosed users in social media.
However, detecting users with these conditions is not a straightforward task as
they may not explicitly talk about their mental state, and if they do,
contextual cues such as immediacy must be taken into account. When available,
linguistic flags pointing to probable anxiety or depression could be used by
medical experts to write better guidelines and treatments. In this paper, we
develop a dataset designed to foster research in depression and anxiety
detection in Twitter, framing the detection task as a binary tweet
classification problem. We then apply state-of-the-art classification models to
this dataset, providing a competitive set of baselines alongside qualitative
error analysis. Our results show that language models perform reasonably well,
and better than more traditional baselines. Nonetheless, there is clear room
for improvement, particularly with unbalanced training sets and in cases where
seemingly obvious linguistic cues (keywords) are used counter-intuitively.",2020,http://arxiv.org/abs/2011.05249v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.05249v1
anxiety,"DASentimental: Detecting depression, anxiety and stress in texts via
  emotional recall, cognitive networks and machine learning","['Asra Fatima', 'Li Ying', 'Thomas Hills', 'Massimo Stella']","Most current affect scales and sentiment analysis on written text focus on
quantifying valence (sentiment) -- the most primary dimension of emotion.
However, emotions are broader and more complex than valence. Distinguishing
negative emotions of similar valence could be important in contexts such as
mental health. This project proposes a semi-supervised machine learning model
(DASentimental) to extract depression, anxiety and stress from written text.
First, we trained the model to spot how sequences of recalled emotion words by
$N=200$ individuals correlated with their responses to the Depression Anxiety
Stress Scale (DASS-21). Within the framework of cognitive network science, we
model every list of recalled emotions as a walk over a networked mental
representation of semantic memory, with emotions connected according to free
associations in people's memory. Among several tested machine learning
approaches, we find that a multilayer perceptron neural network trained on word
sequences and semantic network distances can achieve state-of-art,
cross-validated predictions for depression ($R = 0.7$), anxiety ($R = 0.44$)
and stress ($R = 0.52$). Though limited by sample size, this first-of-its-kind
approach enables quantitative explorations of key semantic dimensions behind
DAS levels. We find that semantic distances between recalled emotions and the
dyad ""sad-happy"" are crucial features for estimating depression levels but are
less important for anxiety and stress. We also find that semantic distance of
recalls from ""fear"" can boost the prediction of anxiety but it becomes
redundant when the ""sad-happy"" dyad is considered. Adopting DASentimental as a
semi-supervised learning tool to estimate DAS in text, we apply it to a dataset
of 142 suicide notes. We conclude by discussing key directions for future
research enabled by artificial intelligence detecting stress, anxiety and
depression.",2021,http://arxiv.org/abs/2110.13710v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.13710v1

anxiety,Rapid Anxiety Reduction (RAR): A unified theory of humor,['Adam Safron'],"Here I propose a novel theory in which humor is the feeling of Rapid Anxiety
Reduction (RAR). According to RAR, humor can be expressed in a simple formula:
-d(A)/dt. RAR has strong correspondences with False Alarm Theory, Benign
Violation Theory, and Cognitive Debugging Theory, all of which represent either
special cases or partial descriptions at alternative levels of analysis. Some
evidence for RAR includes physiological similarities between hyperventilation
and laughter and the fact that smiles often indicate negative affect in
non-human primates (e.g. fear grimaces where teeth are exposed as a kind of
inhibited threat display). In accordance with Benign Violation Theory, if humor
reliably indicates both a) anxiety induction, b) anxiety reduction, and c) the
time-course over which anxiety is reduced, then the intersection of these
conditions productively constrains inference spaces over latent mental states
with respect to the values and capacities of the persons experiencing humor. In
this way, humor is a powerful cypher for understanding persons in both
individual and social contexts, with far-reaching implications. Finally, if
humor can be expressed in such a simple formula with clear ties to
phenomenology, and yet this discovery regarding such an essential part of the
human experience has remained undiscovered for this long, then this is an
extremely surprising state of affairs worthy of further investigation. Towards
this end, I propose an analogy can be found with consciousness studies, where
in addition to the ""Hard problem"" of trying to explain humor, we would do well
to consider a ""Meta-Problem"" of why humor seems so difficult to explain, and
why relatively simple explanations may have eluded us for this long. (Please
note: RAR was conceived in 2008, and last majorly updated in 2012.)",2019,http://arxiv.org/abs/1911.02364v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1911.02364v2

depression and anxiety. Social stigma makes people with depression and anxiety

Text classification techniques can achieve this. One approach that can be used

read sentences from one direction. Meanwhile, Bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM) is a
two-way LSTM that can capture information without ignoring the context and

  Experimental Study","['I. L. Kovalenko', 'N. N. Kudryavtseva']","It is well known that psychoemotional disorders may be accompanied by
decreased sociability in humans. It has been shown that repeated social defeats
in 10 daily agonistic interactions in male mice led to development of the
expressed level of anxiety and to reduction of communication estimated in the
elevated plus-maze and partition tests, respectively. In the social
interactions test, sociable behavior toward unfamiliar partner and exploratory
activity were dramatically decreased in defeated male mice. Avoidance of
approaching partner was significantly increased. Demonstration of self-grooming
behavior was increased in defeated males. Chronic diazepam treatment (0.5
mg/kg, i.p., 2 weeks) led to significant decrease of anxiety level estimated in
the elevated plus maze test and to improvement of communication in the
partition test. In the social interaction test diazepam completely restored the
level of sociability and exploratory activity and reduced avoidance behavior of
approaching partner. Diazepam did not affect self-grooming demonstration. It is
concluded that main factor which provokes decrease in communication in defeated
male mice is the high level of anxiety. Similarity between changes in social
behavior in defeated mice and symptoms of autism in humans is discussed. It is

users who did not receive toxic replies. Finally, analysis results indicate
that the conversation topic and users' account characteristics are likely to

anxiety (LBA). Although having been unveiled for a while, LBA has not been
thoroughly investigated yet. Without a better understanding of LBA, it would be
difficult to precisely validate energy saving and management techniques in
terms of alleviating LBA and enhancing Quality of Experience (QoE) of mobile
users. To fill the gap, we conduct an investigation over 2000+ mobile users,
look into their feelings and reactions towards LBA, and quantify their anxiety
degree during the draining of battery power. As a case study, we also
investigate the impact of LBA on user's behavior at video watching, and with
the massive collected answers we are able to quantify user's abandoning
likelihood of attractive videos versus the battery status of mobile phone. The
empirical findings and quantitative models obtained in this work not only
disclose the characteristics of LBA among modern mobile users, but also provide

  policies on economic and mental distress","['Reka Sundaram-Stukel', 'Richard J Davidson']","Background The COVID-19 pandemic has increased mental distress globally. The
proportion of people reporting anxiety is 26%, and depression is 34% points.
Disentangling associational and causal contributions of behavior, COVID-19
cases, and economic distress on mental distress will dictate different
mitigation strategies to reduce long-term pandemic-related mental distress.
Methods We use the Household Pulse Survey (HPS) April 2020 to February 2021
data to examine mental distress among U.S. citizens attributable to COVID-19.
We combined HPS survey data with publicly available state-level weekly:
COVID-19 case and death data from the Centers for Disease Control, public
policies, and Apple and Google mobility data. Finally, we constructed economic
and mental distress measures to estimate structural models with lag dependent
variables to tease out public health policies' associational and causal path
coefficients on economic and mental distress. Findings From April 2020 to
February 2021, we found that anxiety and depression had steadily climbed in the
U.S. By design, mobility restrictions primarily affected public health policies
where businesses and restaurants absorbed the biggest hit. Period t-1 COVID-19
cases increased job loss by 4.1% and economic distress by 6.3% points in the
same period. Job-loss and housing insecurity in t-1 increased period t mental
distress by 29.1% and 32.7%, respectively. However, t-1 food insecurity
decreased mental distress by 4.9% in time t. The pandemic-related potential
causal path coefficient of period t-1 economic distress on period t depression
is 57.8%, and anxiety is 55.9%. Thus, we show that period t-1 COVID-19 case

  traits in motor imagery BCI","['Jelena Mladenović', 'Jeremy Frey', 'Smeety Pramij', 'Jeremie Mattout', 'Fabien Lotte']","Objective. Neural self-regulation is necessary for achieving control over
brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). This can be an arduous learning process
especially for motor imagery BCI. Various training methods were proposed to
assist users in accomplishing BCI control and increase performance. Notably the
use of biased feedback, i.e. non-realistic representation of performance.
Benefits of biased feedback on performance and learning vary between users
(e.g. depending on their initial level of BCI control) and remain speculative.
To disentangle the speculations, we investigate what personality type, initial
state and calibration performance (CP) could benefit from a biased feedback.
Methods. We conduct an experiment (n=30 for 2 sessions). The feedback provided
to each group (n=10) is either positively, negatively or not biased. Results.
Statistical analyses suggest that interactions between bias and: 1) workload,
2) anxiety, and 3) self-control significantly affect online performance. For
instance, low initial workload paired with negative bias is associated to
higher peak performances (86%) than without any bias (69%). High anxiety
relates negatively to performance no matter the bias (60%), while low anxiety
matches best with negative bias (76%). For low CP, learning rate (LR) increases
with negative bias only short term (LR=2%) as during the second session it
severely drops (LR=-1%). Conclusion. We unveil many interactions between said
human factors and bias. Additionally, we use prediction models to confirm and
reveal even more interactions. Significance. This paper is a first step towards
identifying optimal biased feedback for a personality type, state, and CP in

transportation is replacing internal combustion vehicles with electric vehicles

remain low and uncertain. This shows a research need for an in-depth
understanding of EV adoption behavior with a focus on one of the main barriers
to the mass EV adoption, which is the limited electric driving range. The
present study extends the existing literature in two directions; First, the
influence of the psychological aspect of driving range, which is referred to as
range anxiety, is explored on EV adoption behavior by presenting a nested logit
(NL) model with a latent construct. Second, the two-level NL model captures
individuals' decision on EV adoption behavior distinguished by vehicle
transaction type and EV type, where the upper level yields the vehicle
transaction type selected from the set of alternatives including
no-transaction, sell, trade, and add. The fuel type of the vehicles decided to
be acquired, either as traded-for or added vehicles, is simultaneously
determined at the lower level from a set including conventional vehicle, hybrid
EV, PHEV, and BEV. The model is empirically estimated using a stated

enhances social validation. We perform numerical simulations and mean-field

Nevertheless, the ""range anxiety"" of EV hinders its wider acceptance among

Specifically, the new approach extends the federated-learning structure with
two components: anomaly detection and sharing policy. The first component
identifies preventing factors in model learning, while the second component
offers guidelines for information sharing amongst vehicle networks when the
sharing is necessary to preserve learning efficiency. The two components
collaborate to enhance learning robustness against data heterogeneities in
networks. Numerical experiments are conducted, and the results show that
compared with considered solutions, the proposed approach could provide higher

quantify the multivariate distance between two clusters, regardless of the

for clusters to differ in mean, scale, and rotation. We then demonstrate our

worldwide, resulting in 685,000 fatalities. By the end of the year,
approximately 7.8 million women worldwide had survived their breast cancer
making it the most widespread form of cancer globally. Surgical treatment
decisions, including choosing between oncoplastic options, often require quick
decision-making within an 8-week time frame. However, many women lack the

Anxiety and unsatisfactory outcomes can result from inadequate decision-making

The app provides 3D visualizations of different oncoplastic procedures, aiming
to improve confidence in surgical decision-making, reduce decisional regret,
and enhance patient well-being after surgery. To determine the perception of
the usefulness of Breamy, we collected data from 166 participants through an

of people around the world. To identify individuals who are vulnerable to
depression and anxiety, predictive models have been built that typically
utilize data from one source. Unlike these traditional models, in this study,
we leverage a rich heterogeneous data set from the University of Notre Dame's
NetHealth study that collected individuals' (student participants') social
interaction data via smartphones, health-related behavioral data via wearables
(Fitbit), and trait data from surveys. To integrate the different types of
information, we model the NetHealth data as a heterogeneous information network
(HIN). Then, we redefine the problem of predicting individuals' mental health
conditions (depression or anxiety) in a novel manner, as applying to our HIN a
popular paradigm of a recommender system (RS), which is typically used to
predict the preference that a person would give to an item (e.g., a movie or
book). In our case, the items are the individuals' different mental health
states. We evaluate four state-of-the-art RS approaches. Also, we model the
prediction of individuals' mental health as another problem type - that of node
classification (NC) in our HIN, evaluating in the process four node features
under logistic regression as a proof-of-concept classifier. We find that our RS

regression model using the same NetHealth data in the traditional non-network
fashion as well as a random-approach. Also, we find that the best of the
considered RS approaches outperforms all considered NC approaches. This is the

stressful conditions of an earthquake. For this purpose, a virtual model has
been designed and built from a proposed classroom in a school of the city of

virtual model respectively, were conducted on a statistical sample of 20
students within the range of 20 to 25 years of age. Within the mentioned
sample, the first group of 10 students were taught safety measures in a
traditional classroom. The second group of 10 students participated in a

distributed after two weeks. Furthermore, two self-reporting tests of
Depression, anxiety, stress test (DASS), and Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) were
assigned to the second group to evaluate the effect of foresight under two

  Reanalysis of 18 Published Datasets","['Jonas M B Haslbeck', 'Eiko I Fried']","Background Network analyses on psychopathological data focus on the network
structure and its derivatives such as node centrality. One conclusion one can
draw from centrality measures is that the node with the highest centrality is
likely to be the node that is determined most by its neighboring nodes.
However, centrality is a relative measure: knowing that a node is highly
central gives no information about the extent to which it is determined by its
neighbors. Here we provide an absolute measure of determination (or
controllability) of a node - its predictability. We introduce predictability,
estimate the predictability of all nodes in 18 prior empirical network papers
on psychopathology, and statistically relate it to centrality.
  Methods We carried out a literature review and collected 25 datasets from 18
published papers in the field (several mood and anxiety disorders, substance
abuse, psychosis, autism, and transdiagnostic data). We fit state-of-the-art
net- work models to all datasets, and computed the predictability of all nodes.
  Results Predictability was unrelated to sample size, moderately high in most
symptom networks, and differed considerable both within and between datasets.
Predictability was higher in community than clinical samples, highest for mood
and anxiety disorders, and lowest for psychosis.
  Conclusions Predictability is an important additional characterization of
symptom networks because it gives an absolute measure of the controllability of
each node. It allows conclusions about how self-determined a symptom network
is, and may help to inform intervention strategies. Limitations of
predictability along with future directions are discussed.",2016,http://arxiv.org/abs/1612.06357v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1612.06357v2

  expression profiles: Applications to schizophrenia and depression/anxiety
  disorders","['Kai Zhao', 'Hon-Cheong So']","Development of new medications is a very lengthy and costly process. Finding
novel indications for existing drugs, or drug repositioning, can serve as a
useful strategy to shorten the development cycle. In this study, we present an
approach to drug discovery or repositioning by predicting indication for a
particular disease based on expression profiles of drugs, with a focus on
applications in psychiatry. Drugs that are not originally indicated for the
disease but with high predicted probabilities serve as good candidates for
repurposing. This framework is widely applicable to any chemicals or drugs with
expression profiles measured, even if the drug targets are unknown. It is also
highly flexible as virtually any supervised learning algorithms can be used. We
applied this approach to identify repositioning opportunities for schizophrenia
as well as depression and anxiety disorders. We applied various
state-of-the-art machine learning (ML) approaches for prediction, including
deep neural networks, support vector machines (SVM), elastic net, random forest
and gradient boosted machines. The performance of the five approaches did not
differ substantially, with SVM slightly outperformed the others. However,
methods with lower predictive accuracy can still reveal literature-supported
candidates that are of different mechanisms of actions. As a further
validation, we showed that the repositioning hits are enriched for psychiatric
medications considered in clinical trials. Notably, many top repositioning hits
are supported by previous preclinical or clinical studies. Finally, we propose
that ML approaches may provide a new avenue to explore drug mechanisms via
examining the variable importance of gene features.",2017,http://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03014v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.03014v2

  depressive disorder evaluated with brain electromagnetic tomography","['Vadim Zotev', 'Jerzy Bodurka']","Recently, we reported an emotion self-regulation study (Zotev et al., 2020),
in which patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) used simultaneous
real-time fMRI and EEG neurofeedback (rtfMRI-EEG-nf) to upregulate two fMRI and
two EEG activity measures, relevant to MDD. The target measures included fMRI
activities of the left amygdala and left rostral anterior cingulate cortex, and
frontal EEG asymmetries in the alpha band (FAA) and high-beta band (FBA). Here
we apply the exact low resolution brain electromagnetic tomography (eLORETA) to
investigate EEG source activities during the rtfMRI-EEG-nf procedure. The
exploratory analyses reveal significant changes in hemispheric lateralities of
upper alpha and high-beta current source densities in the prefrontal regions,
consistent with upregulation of the FAA and FBA during the rtfMRI-EEG-nf task.
Similar laterality changes are observed for current source densities in the
amygdala. Prefrontal upper alpha current density changes show significant
negative correlations with anhedonia severity. Changes in prefrontal high-beta
current density are consistent with reduction in comorbid anxiety. Comparisons
with results of previous LORETA studies suggest that the rtfMRI-EEG-nf training
is beneficial to MDD patients, and may have the ability to correct functional
deficiencies associated with anhedonia and comorbid anxiety in MDD.",2020,http://arxiv.org/abs/2006.01923v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.01923v2

rate, mainly due to an increase in affordability and accessibility of the
internet. Many are relying on the web to get diverse perspectives, but at the
same time, it can expose them to content that is harmful to their mental
well-being. Catchy headlines and emotionally charged articles increase the
number of readers which in turn increases ad revenue for websites. When a user
consumes a large quantity of negative content, it adversely impacts the user's
happiness and has a significant impact on his/her mood and state of mind. Many
studies carried out during the COVID-19 pandemic has shown that people across
the globe irrespective of their country of origin have experienced higher
levels of anxiety and depression. Web filters can help in constructing a
digital environment that is more suitable for people prone to depression,
anxiety and stress. A significant amount of work has been done in the field of
web filtering, but there has been limited focus on helping Highly Sensitive
Persons (HSP's) or those with stress disorders induced by trauma. Through this
paper, we propose detox Browser, a simple tool that enables end-users to tune
out of or control their exposure to topics that can affect their mental well

cases, causing more than 667,000 deaths. Countries irrespective of economic
status have succumbed to this pandemic. Many aspects of the lives, including
health, economy, freedom of movement have been negatively affected by the
coronavirus outbreak. Numerous strategies have been taken in order to prevent
the outbreak. Some countries took severe resections in the form of full-scale
lockdown, while others took a moderate approach of dealing with the pandemics,
for example, mass testing, prohibiting large-scale public gatherings,
restricting international travels. South America adopted primarily the lockdown
strategies due to inadequate economy and health care support. Since the social
interactions between the people are primarily affected by the lockdown,
psychological distress, e.g. anxiety, stress, fear are supposedly affecting the
South American population in a severe way. This paper aims to explore the
impact of lockdown over the psychological aspect of the people of all the
Spanish speaking South American capitals. We have utilized infodemiology
approach by employing large-scale Twitter data-set over 33 million feeds in

pandemic, people demonstrated strong emotions (i.e. anxiety, worry, fear) which
declined over time even though the actual pandemic is worsening by having more
positive cases, and inflicting more deaths. This leads us to speculate that the
South American population is adapting to this pandemic thus improving the

and perception of educational topics. The mindset or forma mentis of 159
Italian high school students and of 59 international researchers in STEM are
reconstructed through forma mentis networks, i.e., cognitive networks of
concepts connected by free associations and enriched with sentiment labels. The
layout of conceptual associations between positively/negatively/neutrally
perceived concepts is informative on how people build their own mental
constructs or beliefs about specific topics. Researchers displayed mixed
positive/neutral mental representations of ``teacher'', ``student'' and,
``scientist''. Students' conceptual associations of ``scientist'' were highly
positive and largely non-stereotypical, although links about the ``mad
scientist'' stereotype persisted. Students perceived ``teacher'' as a complex
figure, associated with positive aspects like mentoring/knowledge transmission
but also to negative sides revolving around testing and grading. ``School''
elicited stronger differences between the two groups. In the students' mindset,
``school'' was surrounded by a negative emotional aura or set of associations,
indicating an anxious perception of the school setting, mixing scholastic
concepts, anxiety-eliciting words, STEM disciplines like maths and physics, and
exam-related notions. Researchers' positive stance of ``school'' included
concepts of fun, friendship, and personal growth instead. Along the perspective
of Education Research, the above results are discussed as quantitative evidence
for test- and STEM anxiety co-occurring in the way Italian students perceive
education places and their actors. Detecting these patterns in student

the potential to capture and correlate with clinically alarming deteriorations
in mental health profiles in a non-invasive manner. The goal of this study is
to examine, among college students, the relationship between deteriorating
mental health conditions and changes in user behaviors when engaging with
Google Search and YouTube during COVID-19. This study recruited a cohort of 49
students from a U.S. college campus during January 2020 (prior to the pandemic)
and measured the anxiety and depression levels of each participant. This study
followed up with the same cohort during May 2020 (during the pandemic), and the
anxiety and depression levels were assessed again. The longitudinal Google
Search and YouTube history data were anonymized and collected. From
individual-level Google Search and YouTube histories, we developed 5 signals
that can quantify shifts in online behaviors during the pandemic. We then
assessed the differences between groups with and without deteriorating mental
health profiles in terms of these features. Significant features included
late-night online activities, continuous usages, and time away from the

emotional expressions, shapes our thoughts and actions. In this study, we
incorporate social network theories and analyses and use a computational
approach to investigate how emotional expressions, particularly
\textit{negative discrete emotional expressions} (i.e., anxiety, sadness,
anger, and disgust), lead to differential diffusion of online content in social
media networks. We rigorously quantify diffusion cascades' structural
properties (i.e., size, depth, maximum breadth, and structural virality) and
analyze the individual characteristics (i.e., age, gender, and network degree)
and social ties (i.e., strong and weak) involved in the cascading process. In
our sample, more than six million unique individuals transmitted 387,486
randomly selected articles in a massive-scale online social network, WeChat. We
detect the expression of discrete emotions embedded in these articles, using a
newly generated domain-specific and up-to-date emotion lexicon. We apply a
partial-linear instrumental variable approach with a double machine learning
framework to causally identify the impact of the negative discrete emotions on
online content diffusion. We find that articles with more expressions of
anxiety spread to a larger number of individuals and diffuse more deeply,
broadly, and virally. Expressions of anger and sadness, however, reduce
cascades' size and maximum breadth. We further show that the articles with
different degrees of negative emotional expressions tend to spread differently

science for analyzing latent constructs such as depression, anxiety, quality of

individual's items responses. However, in the presence of repeated item
measures, IRT methods usually assume that the measurement occasions are made at
the exact same time for all patients. In this paper, we show how the IRT
methodology can be combined with the mixed model theory to provide a
longitudinal IRT model which exploits the information of a measurement scale
provided at the item level while simultaneously handling observation times that
may vary across individuals and items. The latent construct is a latent process
defined in continuous time that is linked to the observed item responses
through a measurement model at each individual- and occasion-specific
observation time; we focus here on a Graded Response Model for binary and
ordinal items. The Maximum Likelihood Estimation procedure of the model is
available in the R package lcmm. The proposed approach is contextualized in a
clinical example in end-stage renal disease, the PREDIALA study. The objective
is to study the trajectories of depressive symptomatology (as measured by 7

learning (ML) approaches. Methods - Participants formed spontaneous utterances

Vocal properties (e.g., intensity and duration) of these utterances were
analyzed. Results - Our prediction that, as compared to low-SA (n=31), high-SA
(n=32) individuals exhibit a less confident vocal speech signature, especially
with respect to refusal utterances, was only partially supported by the
classical hypothesis-testing approach. However, the results of the ML analyses

differentiated between refusal and consent utterances. Conclusions - Our

self-limiting perspective that appropriates cognitive bandwidth required for
essential processes like learning in favour of addressing more critical needs

anxiety,"Social capital and resilience make an employee cooperate for coronavirus
  measures and lower his/her turnover intention","['Keisuke Kokubun', 'Yoshiaki Ino', 'Kazuyoshi Ishimura']","An important theme is how to maximize the cooperation of employees when
dealing with crisis measures taken by the company. Therefore, to find out what
kind of employees have cooperated with the company's measures in the current
corona (COVID-19) crisis, and what effect the cooperation has had to these
employees/companies to get hints for preparing for the next crisis, the pass
analysis was carried out using awareness data obtained from a questionnaire
survey conducted on 2,973 employees of Japanese companies in China. The results
showed that employees with higher social capital and resilience were more
supportive of the company's measures against corona and that employees who were
more supportive of corona measures were less likely to leave their jobs.
However, regarding fatigue and anxiety about the corona felt by employees, it
was shown that it not only works to support cooperation in corona
countermeasures but also enhances the turnover intention. This means that just
by raising the anxiety of employees, even if a company achieves the short-term
goal of having them cooperate with the company's countermeasures against
corona, it may not reach the longer-term goal by making them increase their
intention to leave. It is important for employees to be aware of the crisis and
to fear it properly. But more than that, it should be possible for the company
to help employees stay resilient, build good relationships with them, and
increase their social capital to make them support crisis measurement of the
company most effectively while keeping their turnover intention low.",2020,http://arxiv.org/abs/2007.07963v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.07963v3

  during the COVID-19 pandemic? -- A case study in two engineering programs",['Jonathan Álvarez Ariza'],"The COVID-19 pandemic has represented a challenge for higher education in
terms to provide quality education despite the lockdown periods, the
transformation of the in-person classes to virtual classes, and the
demotivation and anxiety that are experimented by the students. Because the
basis of engineering is the experimentation through hands-on activities and
learning by doing, the lockdown periods and the temporary suspension of the
in-person classes and laboratories have meant a problem for educators that try
to teach and motivate the students despite the situation. In this context, this
study presents an educational methodology based on Problem-Based Learning (PBL)
and in-home laboratories in engineering. The methodology was carried out in two
phases during 2020, in the academic programs of Industrial Engineering and
Technology in Electronics with (n=44) students. The in-home laboratories were
sent to the students as part of ""kits"" with the devices needed in each subject.
Besides, due to the difficulties in monitoring the learning process, the
students made videos and blogs as a strategy to reinforce their learning and
evidence the progress in the courses. The outcomes of the methodology show
mainly the following points: (1) An improvement of the academic performance and
learning of the students in the courses. (2) A positive influence of the usage
of in-home laboratories in motivation, self-efficacy, and reduction of anxiety.
(3) Positive correlations between the usage of in-home laboratories, the blogs
and videos, and the teacher's feedback for learning, motivation, and
self-efficacy. Thus, these results evidence that other alternatives that gather
the cognitive and affective learning domains can emerge from engineering to
deal with the educational problems produced by the crisis periods.",2022,http://arxiv.org/abs/2203.16465v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.16465v1

globally. It is projected that mental health disorders will be the leading
cause of morbidity among adults as the incidence rates of anxiety and
depression grows globally. Recently, extended reality (XR), a general term
covering virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR) and mixed reality (MR),
is paving a new way to deliver mental health care. In this paper, we conduct a
scoping review on the development and application of XR in the area of mental
disorders. We performed a scoping database search to identify the relevant
studies indexed in Google Scholar, PubMed, and the ACM Digital Library. A
search period between August 2016 and December 2023 was defined to select
articles related to the usage of VR, AR, and MR in a mental health context. We
identified a total of 85 studies from 27 countries across the globe. By
performing data analysis, we found that most of the studies focused on
developed countries such as the US (16.47%) and Germany (12.94%). None of the
studies were for African countries. The majority of the articles reported that
XR techniques led to a significant reduction in symptoms of anxiety or
depression. More studies were published in the year 2021, i.e., 31.76% (n =
31). This could indicate that mental disorder intervention received a higher
attention when COVID-19 emerged. Most studies (n = 65) focused on a population
between 18 and 65 years old, only a few studies focused on teenagers (n = 2).
Also, more studies were done experimentally (n = 67, 78.82%) rather than by
analytical and modeling approaches (n = 8, 9.41%). This shows that there is a
rapid development of XR technology for mental health care. Furthermore, these
studies showed that XR technology can effectively be used for evaluating mental
disorders in similar or better way as the conventional approaches.",2022,http://arxiv.org/abs/2204.01348v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.01348v2

amygdala, hippocampus and motor systems. At the behavioral level, we propose
that dream narrative evolved as exploratory behavior made in a virtual
environment promoting ""emotional (un)learning"", that is, habituation of

unknown nuisance factors that may considerably challenge the validity of a

mathematically simple models. However, they all demonstrate that the optimism
with respect to randomization is wishful thinking rather than based on fact. In
small to medium-sized samples, random allocation of units to treatments
typically yields a considerable imbalance between the groups, i.e., confounding
due to randomization is the rule rather than the exception.
  In the second part of this contribution, we extend the reasoning to a number
of traditional arguments for and against randomization. This discussion is
rather non-technical, and at times even ""foundational"" (Frequentist vs.
Bayesian). However, its result turns out to be quite similar. While
randomization's contribution remains questionable, comparability contributes

anxiety,A Possible Role for Entropy in Creative Cognition,['Liane Gabora'],"This paper states the case for applying the conceptual and analytic tools
associated with the study of entropy in physical systems to cognition, focusing
on creative cognition. It is proposed that minds modify their contents and
adapt to their environments to minimize psychological entropy:
arousal-provoking uncertainty, which can be experienced negatively as anxiety,
or positively as a wellspring for creativity (or both). Thus, intrinsically
motivated creativity begins with detection of high psychological entropy
material (e.g., a question or inconsistency), which provokes uncertainty and is
arousal-inducing. This material is recursively considering from new contexts
until it is sufficiently restructured that arousal dissipates and entropy
reaches an acceptable level. Restructuring involves neural synchrony and
dynamic binding, and may be facilitated by temporarily shifting to a more
associative mode of thought. The creative outcome may similarly induce
restructuring in others, and thereby contribute to the cultural evolution of
more nuanced understandings. Thus, the concept of entropy could play a unifying
role in cognitive science as a driver of thought and action, and in cultural
studies as the driver of the creative innovations that fuel cultural evolution.
The paper concludes with an invitation for cross-disciplinary exploration of
this potential new arena of entropy studies.",2016,http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.03605v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1611.03605v1

for increasing anxiety levels and/or larger number of individuals trying to
leave the room through the same door. Our investigation shows, however, that
very high pressures alters the dynamics in the blocking cluster, and thus,
changes the statistics of the time delays along the escaping process. It can be
acknowledged a reduction in the long lasting delays, while the overall
evacuation performance improves. We present results on this novel phenomenon

It is found, motorways are usually less favourable for drivers of (PH)EVs

access to the place where the presentation will happen. In this research, we
developed a Virtual Reality (VR) environment to assist in improving people's
presentation skills. Our system uses 3D scanned people to create more realistic

experience with VR. We validated our virtual environment by analyzing whether
it was preferred to no VR system and accepted regardless of the existence of a

highly educated individuals in the general population. This situation presents
a serious problem for universities. Thus, the knowledge about this phenomenon
is of great importance in decision-making. In this paper we use the Nature PhD
survey 2019 and estimate several binomial logistic regression models to analyze
the risk of interrupting doctoral studies. This risk is measured through the
desire of change in either the supervisor or the area of expertise, or the wish
of not pursue a PhD. Among the explanatory factors, we focus on the influence
of anxiety/depression, discrimination, and bullying. As control variables we
use demographic characteristics and others related with the doctoral program.
Insufficient contact time with supervisors, and exceeding time spent studying
-crossing the 50-h week barrier-, are risk factors of PhD studies interruption,
but the most decisive risk factor is poor mental health. Universities should
therefore foster an environment of well-being, which allows the development of

nowcasting GDP growth as well as a simulation study demonstrate that the
horseshoe prior BSTS improves markedly upon the SSVS and the original BSTS

driven communications which transformed the interference into a goal driven
functionality of man-machine collaboration. Reviewing the debates post the
debacle, we reflect upon the policy consequences of the use of Social Botnets
and understand the impact of their adversarial operation in terms of catalysing
institutional decay, growing infrastructural anxieties, increased industry
regulations, more vulnerable Individuals and more distorted ideas, and most
importantly, the emergence of an unintended constituency in form of the bot
agency itself. The article first briefly introduces the nature and evolution of
Social Botnets, and then moves over to discussing the policy consequences. For
future work, it is important to understand the agency and collective properties
of these software robots, in order to design the institutional and
socio-technical mechanisms which mitigate the risk of adversarial social
engineering using these bots from interfering into democratic processes.",2022,http://arxiv.org/abs/2205.04830v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.04830v1

semi-structured interviews with a sample of 235 social media users. Work on
social media misinformation does not investigate how ordinary users - the
target of misinformation - deal with it; rather, the focus is mostly on the
anxiety, tensions, or divisions misinformation creates. Studying the aspects of
creation, diffusion and amplification also overlooks how misinformation is
internalized by users on social media and thus is quick to prescribe
""inoculation"" strategies for the presumed lack of immunity to misinformation.
How users grapple with social media content to develop ""natural immunity"" as a
precursor to misinformation resilience remains an open question. We have
identified at least five folk models that conceptualize misinformation as
either: political (counter)argumentation, out-of-context narratives, inherently
fallacious information, external propaganda, or simply entertainment. We use
the rich conceptualizations embodied in these folk models to uncover how social
media users minimize adverse reactions to misinformation encounters in their

proposed model outperforms conventional methods as well as providing 1.63%
higher mean accuracy score compared to the state-of-the-art model while
maintaining a low standard deviation. Our experiments also show that combining

  Settings","['Ali Tazarv', 'Sina Labbaf', 'Stephanie M. Reich', 'Nikil Dutt', 'Amir M. Rahmani', 'Marco Levorato']","Since stress contributes to a broad range of mental and physical health
problems, the objective assessment of stress is essential for behavioral and
physiological studies. Although several studies have evaluated stress levels in
controlled settings, objective stress assessment in everyday settings is still
largely under-explored due to challenges arising from confounding contextual
factors and limited adherence for self-reports. In this paper, we explore the
objective prediction of stress levels in everyday settings based on heart rate
(HR) and heart rate variability (HRV) captured via low-cost and easy-to-wear
photoplethysmography (PPG) sensors that are widely available on newer smart
wearable devices. We present a layered system architecture for personalized
stress monitoring that supports a tunable collection of data samples for
labeling, and present a method for selecting informative samples from the
stream of real-time data for labeling. We captured the stress levels of
fourteen volunteers through self-reported questionnaires over periods of
between 1-3 months, and explored binary stress detection based on HR and HRV
using Machine Learning Methods. We observe promising preliminary results given
that the dataset is collected in the challenging environments of everyday

  Non-intrusive Stress Detection","['Yi Xiao', 'Harshit Sharma', 'Zhongyang Zhang', 'Dessa Bergen-Cico', 'Tauhidur Rahman', 'Asif Salekin']","Stress impacts our physical and mental health as well as our social life. A
passive and contactless indoor stress monitoring system can unlock numerous
important applications such as workplace productivity assessment, smart homes,
and personalized mental health monitoring. While the thermal signatures from a
user's body captured by a thermal camera can provide important information
about the ""fight-flight"" response of the sympathetic and parasympathetic
nervous system, relying solely on thermal imaging for training a stress
prediction model often lead to overfitting and consequently a suboptimal
performance. This paper addresses this challenge by introducing ThermaStrain, a
novel co-teaching framework that achieves high-stress prediction performance by
transferring knowledge from the wearable modality to the contactless thermal
modality. During training, ThermaStrain incorporates a wearable electrodermal
activity (EDA) sensor to generate stress-indicative representations from
thermal videos, emulating stress-indicative representations from a wearable EDA
sensor. During testing, only thermal sensing is used, and stress-indicative
patterns from thermal data and emulated EDA representations are extracted to
improve stress assessment. The study collected a comprehensive dataset with
thermal video and EDA data under various stress conditions and distances.
ThermaStrain achieves an F1 score of 0.8293 in binary stress classification,
outperforming the thermal-only baseline approach by over 9%. Extensive
evaluations highlight ThermaStrain's effectiveness in recognizing
stress-indicative attributes, its adaptability across distances and stress

  Convolutional Encoder-Decoder Learning","['Ankit Shrivastava', 'Jingxiao Liu', 'Kaushik Dayal', 'Hae Young Noh']","This work presents a machine learning approach to predict peak-stress
clusters in heterogeneous polycrystalline materials. Prior work on using
machine learning in the context of mechanics has largely focused on predicting
the effective response and overall structure of stress fields. However, their
ability to predict peak stresses -- which are of critical importance to failure
-- is unexplored, because the peak-stress clusters occupy a small spatial
volume relative to the entire domain, and hence requires computationally
expensive training. This work develops a deep-learning based Convolutional
Encoder-Decoder method that focuses on predicting peak-stress clusters,
specifically on the size and other characteristics of the clusters in the
framework of heterogeneous linear elasticity. This method is based on
convolutional filters that model local spatial relations between
microstructures and stress fields using spatially weighted averaging
operations. The model is first trained against linear elastic calculations of
stress under applied macroscopic strain in synthetically-generated
microstructures, which serves as the ground truth. The trained model is then
applied to predict the stress field given a (synthetically-generated)
microstructure and then to detect peak-stress clusters within the predicted
stress field. The accuracy of the peak-stress predictions is analyzed using the
cosine similarity metric and by comparing the geometric characteristics of the
peak-stress clusters against the ground-truth calculations. It is observed that
the model is able to learn and predict the geometric details of the peak-stress
clusters and, in particular, performed better for higher (normalized) values of
the peak stress as compared to lower values of the peak stress. These
comparisons showed that the proposed method is well-suited to predict the

resonators, masks, or microwave antennas, to a diamond surface. Due to
different thermal expansions of involved materials, such films and structures
could produce significant stresses, which need to be measured or predicted. In
this paper, we demonstrate imaging of stresses in the top layer of diamond with
deposited structures of Cr$_2$O$_3$ at temperatures 19$^{\circ}$C and
37$^{\circ}$C by using stress-sensitive optically detected magnetic resonances
(ODMR) in NV centers. We also calculated stresses in the diamond-film interface

shifts. As predicted by the simulation, the measured high-contrast
frequency-shift patterns are only due to thermal stresses, whose spin-stress
coupling constant along the NV axis is 21$\pm$1 MHz/GPa, that is in agreement
with constants previously obtained from single NV centers in diamond
cantilever. We demonstrate that NV microscopy is a convenient platform for
optically detecting and quantifying spatial distributions of stresses in
diamond-based photonic devices with micrometer precision and propose thin films

Multi-modal learning aims to capitalize on the strength of each modality rather
than relying on a single signal. Given the complexity of processing and

stress detection,The Ability of Significant Tidal Stress to Initiate Plate Tectonics,"['J. J. Zanazzi', 'Amaury H. M. J. Triaud']","Plate tectonics is a geophysical process currently unique to Earth, has an
important role in regulating the Earth's climate, and may be better understood
by identifying rocky planets outside our solar system with tectonic activity.
The key criterion for whether or not plate tectonics may occur on a terrestrial
planet is if the stress on a planet's lithosphere from mantle convection may
overcome the lithosphere's yield stress. Although many rocky exoplanets closely
orbiting their host stars have been detected, all studies to date of plate
tectonics on exoplanets have neglected tidal stresses in the planet's
lithosphere. Modeling a rocky exoplanet as a constant density, homogeneous,
incompressible sphere, we show the tidal stress from the host star acting on
close-in planets may become comparable to the stress on the lithosphere from
mantle convection. We also show that tidal stresses from planet-planet
interactions are unlikely to be significant for plate tectonics, but may be
strong enough to trigger Earthquakes. Our work may imply planets orbiting close
to their host stars are more likely to experience plate tectonics, with
implications for exoplanetary geophysics and habitability. We produce a list of
detected rocky exoplanets under the most intense stresses. Atmospheric and
topographic observations may confirm our predictions in the near future.
Investigations of planets with significant tidal stress can not only lead to
observable parameters linked to the presence of active plate tectonics, but may
also be used as a tool to test theories on the main driving force behind
tectonic activity.",2017,http://arxiv.org/abs/1711.09898v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1711.09898v2

  Photoplethysmography Sensor","['Nafiul Rashid', 'Luke Chen', 'Manik Dautta', 'Abel Jimenez', 'Peter Tseng', 'Mohammad Abdullah Al Faruque']","Stress is a physiological state that hampers mental health and has serious
consequences to physical health. Moreover, the COVID-19 pandemic has increased
stress levels among people across the globe. Therefore, continuous monitoring
and detection of stress are necessary. The recent advances in wearable devices
have allowed the monitoring of several physiological signals related to stress.
Among them, wrist-worn wearable devices like smartwatches are most popular due
to their convenient usage. And the photoplethysmography (PPG) sensor is the
most prevalent sensor in almost all consumer-grade wrist-worn smartwatches.
Therefore, this paper focuses on using a wrist-based PPG sensor that collects
Blood Volume Pulse (BVP) signals to detect stress which may be applicable for
consumer-grade wristwatches. Moreover, state-of-the-art works have used either
classical machine learning algorithms to detect stress using hand-crafted
features or have used deep learning algorithms like Convolutional Neural
Network (CNN) which automatically extracts features. This paper proposes a
novel hybrid CNN (H-CNN) classifier that uses both the hand-crafted features
and the automatically extracted features by CNN to detect stress using the BVP
signal. Evaluation on the benchmark WESAD dataset shows that, for 3-class
classification (Baseline vs. Stress vs. Amusement), our proposed H-CNN
outperforms traditional classifiers and normal CNN by 5% and 7% accuracy, and
10% and 7% macro F1 score, respectively. Also for 2-class classification
(Stress vs. Non-stress), our proposed H-CNN outperforms traditional classifiers

the traditional convolutional kernel to capture both local and global responses
to plant stress in various time-scale and improve computing efficiency with
reduced learning parameters in Fourier domain; 2) Capsule Feature Encoder to

labeled datasets that can be utilized to build machine learning models for
accurately detecting periods and levels of stress. The aim of this review is to
provide an overview of the current state of stress detection and monitoring
using wearable devices, and where applicable, machine learning techniques
utilized.
  Methods. This study reviewed published works contributing and/or using
datasets designed for detecting stress and their associated machine learning
methods, with a systematic review and meta-analysis of those that utilized
wearable sensor data as stress biomarkers. The electronic databases of Google
Scholar, Crossref, DOAJ and PubMed were searched for relevant articles and a
total of 24 articles were identified and included in the final analysis. The
reviewed works were synthesized into three categories of publicly available
stress datasets, machine learning, and future research directions.
  Results. A wide variety of study-specific test and measurement protocols were
noted in the literature. A number of public datasets were identified that are
labeled for stress detection. In addition, we discuss that previous works show
shortcomings in areas such as their labeling protocols, lack of statistical

ailments is challenging and involves multiple factors. Such identification can
be achieved accurately by fusing these multiple modalities (due to various

(e.g., face expressions, posture, heart rate, computer interaction). This data
can be securely stored and analyzed to understand and discover personalized
unique behavioral patterns leading to mental strain and fatigue. The
contribution of this work is twofold; proposing a multimodal AI-based strategy
for fusion to detect stress and its level and secondly identify a stress

One function of wearable health devices is stress detection, which relies on
sensor inputs to determine the mental state of patients. This continuous,
real-time monitoring can provide healthcare professionals with vital
physiological data and enhance the quality of patient care. Current methods of
stress detection lack: (i) robustness -- wearable health sensors contain high
levels of measurement noise that degrades performance, and (ii) adaptation --
static architectures fail to adapt to changing contexts in sensing conditions.
We propose to address these deficiencies with SELF-CARE, a generalized
selective sensor fusion method of stress detection that employs novel
techniques of context identification and ensemble machine learning. SELF-CARE
uses a learning-based classifier to process sensor features and model the
environmental variations in sensing conditions known as the noise context.
SELF-CARE uses noise context to selectively fuse different sensor combinations
across an ensemble of models to perform robust stress classification. Our
findings suggest that for wrist-worn devices, sensors that measure motion are
most suitable to understand noise context, while for chest-worn devices, the
most suitable sensors are those that detect muscle contraction. SELF-CARE
demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on the WESAD dataset. Using
wrist-based sensors, SELF-CARE achieves 86.34% and 94.12% accuracy for the

the stress level is elevated when the degradation value of a product crosses a
pre-specified value, was proposed. The times of stress level elevating are
random and vary from product to product. In this paper we extend this model to
a more economic plan. The proposed extended model has two economical advantages
compared with the previous one. The first is that the times of stress level
elevating in the new model are identical for all products, which enable us to
use only one chamber (oven) for testing all test units. The second is that, the
new method does not require continuous inspection and to elevate the stress
level, it is not necessary for the experimenter to inspect the value of the
degradation continually. The new method decrease the cost of measurement and
also there is no need to use electronic sensors to detect the first passage
time of the degradation to the threshold value in the new method. We assume
that the degradation path follows a gamma process. The stress level is elevated
as soon as the measurement of the degradation of one of the test units, at one
of the specified times, exceeds the threshold value. Under the constraint that
the total experimental cost does not exceed a pre-specified budget, the optimal

affective states (labels) while also selecting only the most informative data
points to query from an oracle. In this paper, we propose a framework with
capabilities to represent model uncertainties through approximations in
Bayesian Neural Networks using Monte-Carlo (MC) Dropout. This is combined with
suitable acquisition functions for active learning. Empirical results on a
popular stress and affect detection dataset experimented on a Raspberry Pi 2

healthcare, and social interactions. Many works have studied handcrafted
features from various bio-signals that are indicators of stress. Recently, deep
learning models have also been proposed to detect stress. Typically, stress
models are trained and validated on the same dataset, often involving one
stressful scenario. However, it is not practical to collect stress data for
every scenario. So, it is crucial to study the generalizability of these models
and determine to what extent they can be used in other scenarios. In this
paper, we explore the generalization capabilities of Electrocardiogram
(ECG)-based deep learning models and models based on handcrafted ECG features,
i.e., Heart Rate Variability (HRV) features. To this end, we train three HRV
models and two deep learning models that use ECG signals as input. We use ECG
signals from two popular stress datasets - WESAD and SWELL-KW - differing in
terms of stressors and recording devices. First, we evaluate the models using
leave-one-subject-out (LOSO) cross-validation using training and validation
samples from the same dataset. Next, we perform a cross-dataset validation of
the models, that is, LOSO models trained on the WESAD dataset are validated
using SWELL-KW samples and vice versa. While deep learning models achieve the
best results on the same dataset, models based on HRV features considerably
outperform them on data from a different dataset. This trend is observed for
all the models on both datasets. Therefore, HRV models are a better choice for
stress recognition in applications that are different from the dataset
scenario. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to compare the

The measurements can be used to detect affective states of a person with aims
such as improving human-computer interactions. There are several methods of
collecting physiological data, but wearable sensors are a common, non-invasive
tool for accurate readings. However, valuable information is hard to extract
from the raw physiological data, especially for affective state detection.
Machine Learning techniques are used to detect the affective state of a person
through labeled physiological data. A clear problem with using labeled data is
creating accurate labels. An expert is needed to analyze a form of recording of
participants and mark sections with different states such as stress and calm.
While expensive, this method delivers a complete dataset with labeled data that
can be used in any number of supervised algorithms. An interesting question
arises from the expensive labeling: how can we reduce the cost while
maintaining high accuracy? Semi-Supervised learning (SSL) is a potential
solution to this problem. These algorithms allow for machine learning models to
be trained with only a small subset of labeled data (unlike unsupervised which
use no labels). They provide a way of avoiding expensive labeling. This paper

unreliable estimate of the accuracy on new data. In this paper, we employ
stress testing to assess model robustness and subgroup performance disparities
in disease detection models. We design progressive stress testing using five
different bidirectional and unidirectional image perturbations with six
different severity levels. As a use case, we apply stress tests to measure the
robustness of disease detection models for chest X-ray and skin lesion images,
and demonstrate the importance of studying class and domain-specific model
behaviour. Our experiments indicate that some models may yield more robust and

in semiconductor nanowires using uniaxial stress. For n-type nanowires the
uniaxial stress tunes the effective chemical potential, while for p-type

far the strongest tidal triggering signals are in volcanic areas of mid-ocean

even the most basic mechanism of tidal triggering at the ridges has been
elusive. The triggering occurs at low tides, but as the earthquakes are of the
normal faulting type, low tides should inhibit rather than encourage faulting.
Here, treating the most well documented case, Axial Volcano on the Juan de Fuca
ridge, we show that the axial magma chamber inflates or deflates in response to
tidal stresses and produces Coulomb stresses on normal faults opposite in sign
to those produced by the tidal stresses. If the bulk modulus of the magma
chamber is below a critical value, the magma chamber Coulomb stresses will
exceed the tidal ones and the phase of tidal triggering will be inverted. The

  Coercion Attacks","['Max Wolotsky', 'Mohammad Husain', 'Elisha Choe']","Current alphanumeric and biometric authentication systems cannot withstand
situations where a user is coerced into releasing their authentication
materials under hostile circumstances. Existing approaches of coercion
resistant authentication systems (CRAS) propose authentication factors such as
implicit learning tasks, which are non-transferable, but still have the
drawback that an attacker can force the victim (causing stress) to perform the
task in order to gain unauthorized access. Alternatively, there could be cases
where the user could claim that they were coerced into giving up the
authentication materials, whereas in reality they acted as an insider attacker.
Therefore, being able to detect stress during authentication also helps to
achieve non-repudiation in such cases. To address these concerns, we need CRAS
that have both the non-transferable property as well as a mechanism to detect
stress related to coercion. In this paper, we study the feasibility of using
Chill (intensely pleasurable) music as a stimulus to elicit unique
neuro-physiological responses that can be used as an authenticating factor for
CRAS. Chill music and stress are both stimuli for a neuro-chemical called
Dopamine. However, they release the Dopamine at different parts of the brain,
resulting in different neuro-physiological responses, which gives us both the
non-transferable and stress-detection properties necessary for CRAS. We have
experimentally validated our proposed Chill music based CRAS using human

combine non-invasive image analysis and machine learning, have been
successfully applied to identify and quantify plant health and diseases.
However, these techniques usually do not consider the progressive nature of
plant stress and often require images showing severe signs of stress to ensure
high confidence detection, thereby reducing the feasibility for early detection
and recovery of plants under stress. To overcome the problem mentioned above,
we propose a deep learning pipeline for the temporal analysis of the visual
changes induced in the plant due to stress and apply it to the specific water
stress identification case in Chickpea plant shoot images. For this, we have
considered an image dataset of two chickpea varieties JG-62 and Pusa-372, under
three water stress conditions; control, young seedling, and before flowering,
captured over five months. We have employed a variant of Convolutional Neural
Network - Long Short Term Memory (CNN-LSTM) network to learn spatio-temporal
patterns from the chickpea plant dataset and use them for water stress
classification. Our model has achieved ceiling level classification performance
of 98.52% on JG-62 and 97.78% on Pusa-372 chickpea plant data and has
outperformed the best reported time-invariant technique by at least 14% for
both JG-62 and Pusa-372 species, to the best of our knowledge. Furthermore, our
CNN-LSTM model has demonstrated robustness to noisy input, with a less than
2.5% dip in average model accuracy and a small standard deviation about the
mean for both species. Lastly, we have performed an ablation study to analyze
the performance of the CNN-LSTM model by decreasing the number of temporal

  Approach","['Anup Anand Deshmukh', 'Catherine Soladie', 'Renaud Seguier']","Emotion plays a key role in many applications like healthcare, to gather
patients emotional behavior. There are certain emotions which are given more
importance due to their effectiveness in understanding human feelings. In this
paper, we propose an approach that models human stress from audio signals. The
research challenge in speech emotion detection is defining the very meaning of
stress and being able to categorize it in a precise manner. Supervised Machine
Learning models, including state of the art Deep Learning classification
methods, rely on the availability of clean and labelled data. One of the
problems in affective computation and emotion detection is the limited amount
of annotated data of stress. The existing labelled stress emotion datasets are
highly subjective to the perception of the annotator.
  We address the first issue of feature selection by exploiting the use of
traditional MFCC features in Convolutional Neural Network. Our experiments show
that Emo-CNN consistently and significantly outperforms the popular existing
methods over multiple datasets. It achieves 90.2% categorical accuracy on the
Emo-DB dataset. To tackle the second and the more significant problem of
subjectivity in stress labels, we use Lovheim's cube, which is a 3-dimensional
projection of emotions. The cube aims at explaining the relationship between
these neurotransmitters and the positions of emotions in 3D space. The learnt
emotion representations from the Emo-CNN are mapped to the cube using three
component PCA (Principal Component Analysis) which is then used to model human
stress. This proposed approach not only circumvents the need for labelled
stress data but also complies with the psychological theory of emotions given
by Lovheim's cube. We believe that this work is the first step towards creating
a connection between Artificial Intelligence and the chemistry of human

analysis in precision agriculture demonstrated a potential for improved crop
management and reduced environmental impacts of agricultural production.
Despite the promising results, the practical relevance of these technologies
for field deployment requires novel algorithms that are customized for analysis
of agricultural images and robust to implementation on natural field imagery.
The paper presents an approach for analyzing aerial images of a potato (Solanum
tuberosum L.) crop using deep neural networks. The main objective is to
demonstrate automated spatial recognition of healthy vs. stressed crop at a
plant level. Specifically, we examine premature plant senescence resulting in
drought stress on Russet Burbank potato plants. We propose a novel deep
learning (DL) model for detecting crop stress, named Retina-UNet-Ag. The
proposed architecture is a variant of Retina-UNet and includes connections from
low-level semantic representation maps to the feature pyramid network. The
paper also introduces a dataset of aerial field images acquired with a Parrot
Sequoia camera. The dataset includes manually annotated bounding boxes of
healthy and stressed plant regions. Experimental validation demonstrated the
ability for distinguishing healthy and stressed plants in field images,
achieving an average dice score coefficient (DSC) of 0.74. A comparison to

  Context? A Naturalistic Study","['Arash Tavakoli', 'Nathan Lai', 'Vahid Balali', 'Arsalan Heydarian']","Understanding and mitigating drivers' negative emotions, stress levels, and
anxiety is of high importance for decreasing accident rates, and enhancing road
safety. While detecting drivers' stress and negative emotions can significantly
help with this goal, understanding what might be associated with increases in
drivers' negative emotions and high stress level, might better help with
planning interventions. While studies have provided significant insight into
detecting drivers' emotions and stress levels, not many studies focused on the
reasons behind changes in stress levels and negative emotions. In this study,
by using a naturalistic driving study database, we analyze the changes in the
driving scene, including road objects and the dynamical relationship between
the ego vehicle and the lead vehicle with respect to changes in drivers'
psychophysiological metrics (i.e., heart rate (HR) and facial expressions). Our
results indicate that different road objects might be associated with varying
levels of increase in drivers' HR as well as different proportions of negative
facial emotions detected through computer vision. Larger vehicles on the road,
such as trucks and buses, are associated with the highest amount of increase in
drivers' HR as well as negative emotions. Additionally, shorter distances and
higher standard deviation in the distance to the lead vehicle are associated
with a higher number of abrupt increases in drivers' HR, depicting a possible
increase in stress level. Our finding indicates more positive emotions, lower
facial engagement, and a lower abrupt increase in HR at a higher speed of
driving, which often happens in highway environments. This research
collectively shows that driving at higher speeds happening in highways by
avoiding certain road objects might be a better fit for keeping drivers in a

heterogeneous microstructures, like the ones of dual-phase steels, the
influence of the applied stress state is a key element. In this work, we
studied the influence of the globally applied stress state on the evolution of
damage in such a microstructure. Classical damage models allow predictions of
damage during deformation based on considerations of the material as an
isotropic continuum. Here, we investigate their validity in a dual phase
microstructure that is locally dominated by its microstructural morphological
complexity based on a statistical ensemble of thousands of individual voids
formed under different stress states. For this purpose, we combined a
calibrated material model incorporating damage formation to assess the local
stress state in samples with different notch geometries and high-resolution
electron microscopy of large areas using a deep learning-based automated
micrograph analysis to detect and classify microstructural voids according to
their source of origin. This allowed us to obtain both the continuum stress
state during deformation and statistically relevant data of individual void
formation. We found that the applied plastic strain is the major influence on
the overall number, and therefore the nucleation of new voids, while
triaxiality correlates with the median void size, supporting its proposed
influence on void growth. In contrast, coalescence of voids leading to failure
appears related to local instabilities in the form of shear band formation and
is therefore only indirectly determined by the global stress state in that it
determines the global distribution, density and size of voids.",2020,http://arxiv.org/abs/2006.02773v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.02773v1

an insufficient stress to induce local yielding of the material. Under acoustic
excitation, trapped bubbles can be driven into volumetric oscillations and
apply an additional local strain and stress that can trigger yielding and
assist their release. In this paper we explore different regimes of microbubble
oscillation and translation driven by an ultrasound field in a model
yield-stress fluid, a Carbopol microgel. We first analyse the linear bubble
oscillation dynamics to measure the local, high-frequency viscosity of the
material. We then use acoustic pressure gradients to induce bubble translation
and examine the elastic part of the response of the material below yielding. We
find that, at moderate pressure amplitude, the additional stresses applied by
volumetric oscillations and acoustic radiation forces do not lead to any
detectable irreversible bubble motion. At high pressure amplitude, we observe
non-spherical shape oscillations that result in erratic bubble motion. The
shape modes and critical pressures we observe differ from the predictions of a
recent model of shape oscillations in soft solids.Based on our findings, we
discuss possible reasons for the lack of bubble release in Carbopol and suggest
other systems in which ultrasound-assisted bubble rise may be observed.",2020,http://arxiv.org/abs/2006.03884v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.03884v2

Motivated by the need to address the significant costs of driver stress, it is
essential to build a practical system that can classify driver stress level

levels classification system depends on hyperparameter optimization choices
such as data segmentation (windowing hyperparameters). The configuration
setting of hyperparameters, which has an enormous impact on the system
performance, are typically hand-tuned while evaluating the algorithm. This
tuning process is time consuming and often depends on personal experience.
There are also no generic optimal values for hyperparameters values. In this

stress detection,"Restrictions on possible forms of classical matter fields carrying no
  energy",['Leszek M. Sokolowski'],"It is postulated in general relativity that the matter energy-momentum tensor
(named the stress tensor) vanishes if and only if all the matter fields vanish.
In classical lagrangian field theory the stres tensor is the variational
(symmetric) one and a priori it might occur that for some systems the tensor is
identically zero for all field configurations whereas evolution of the system
is subject to deterministic equations of motion. Such a system would not
generate its own gravitational field. To check if suchsystems may exist we find
a relationship between the stress tensor and the Euler operator. We prove that
if a system of n interacting scalar fields (n cannot exceed the spacetime
dimension d) or a single vector field (if d is even) has the stress tensor such
that its divergence is identically zero (""on and off shell""), then the Lagrange
equations of motion hold identically too. These systems are unphysical as
having no propagation equations at all. Thus nontrivial field equations imply
the nontrivial stress tensor. The theorem breaks down if the of the field
components n is greater than d. We show that for n>d matter systems without
energy and their own gravity (and yet detectable) are in principle admissible.
Their equations of motion are degenerate. We also show for which matter systems
their stress tensors cannot vanish for all solutions of the field equations.",2003,http://arxiv.org/abs/gr-qc/0310113v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/gr-qc/0310113v1

extracting deep feature representations is a significant barrier to its
widespread adoption, particularly for use in embedded devices. One particularly
promising strategy to addressing the complexity issue is the notion of
evolutionary synthesis of deep neural networks, which was demonstrated to
successfully produce highly efficient deep neural networks while retaining
modeling performance. Here, we further extend upon the evolutionary synthesis
strategy for achieving efficient feature extraction via the introduction of a
stress-induced evolutionary synthesis framework, where stress signals are
imposed upon the synapses of a deep neural network during training to induce
stress and steer the synthesis process towards the production of more efficient
deep neural networks over successive generations and improved model fidelity at
a greater efficiency. The proposed stress-induced evolutionary synthesis
approach is evaluated on a variety of different deep neural network
architectures (LeNet5, AlexNet, and YOLOv2) on different tasks (object
classification and object detection) to synthesize efficient StressedNets over
multiple generations. Experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of the
proposed framework to synthesize StressedNets with significant improvement in
network architecture efficiency (e.g., 40x for AlexNet and 33x for YOLOv2) and

the hydromechanical properties of the designated host rock, the
Callovo-Oxfordian claystone (COx), are investigated in laboratory tests.
Experiments presented in this study are carried out to determine several
coefficients required within a transversely isotropic material model. They
include isotropic compression tests, pore pressure tests, and deviatoric
loading tests parallel and perpendicular to the bedding plane. We emphasize the
adapted experimental devices and testing procedures, necessary to detect small
strains under high pressures, on a material, which is sensitive to water and
has a very low permeability. In particular, we discovered a significant
decrease of elastic stiffness with decreasing effective stress, which was
observed to be reversible. In both isotropic and deviatoric tests, a notable
anisotropic strain response was found. The Young modulus parallel to bedding
was about 1.8 times higher than the one perpendicular to the bedding plane. A
notably low Poisson ratio perpendicular to the bedding plane with values
between 0.1 and 0.2 was evidenced. While the anisotropy of the back-calculated
Biot coefficient was found to be low, a significant anisotropy of the Skempton
coefficient was computed. The performed experiments provide an overdetermined
set of material parameters at different stress levels. Using all determined
parameters in a least square error regression scheme, seven independent elastic
coefficients and their effective stress dependency are characterized.
Parameters measured under isotropic loading are well represented by this set of

  General Interconnects","['Mohammad Abdullah Al Shohel', 'Vidya A. Chhabria', 'Sachin S. Sapatnekar']","Electromigration (EM) is a key reliability issue in deeply scaled technology
nodes. Traditional EM methods first filter immortal wires using the Blech
criterion, and then perform EM analysis based on Black's equation on the
remaining wires. The Blech criterion is based on finding the steady-state
stress in a two-terminal wire segment, but most on-chip structures are
considerably more complex. Current-density-based assessment methodologies,
i.e., Black's equation and the Blech criterion, which are predominantly used to
detect EM-susceptible wires, do not capture the physics of EM, but alternative
physics-based methods involve the solution of differential equations and are
slow. This paper uses first principles, based on solving fundamental stress
equations that relate electron wind and back-stress forces to the stress
evolution in an interconnect, and devises a technique that analyzes any general
tree or mesh interconnect structure to test for immortality. The resulting
solution is extremely computationally efficient and its computation time is
linear in the number of metal segments. Two variants of the method are
proposed: a current-density-based method that requires traversals of the
interconnect graph, and a voltage-based formulation negates the need for any
traversals. The methods are applied to large interconnect networks for
determining the steady-state stress at all nodes and test all segments of each
network for immortality. The proposed model is applied to a variety of tree and

  emotional recall, cognitive networks and machine learning","['Asra Fatima', 'Li Ying', 'Thomas Hills', 'Massimo Stella']","Most current affect scales and sentiment analysis on written text focus on
quantifying valence (sentiment) -- the most primary dimension of emotion.
However, emotions are broader and more complex than valence. Distinguishing
negative emotions of similar valence could be important in contexts such as
mental health. This project proposes a semi-supervised machine learning model
(DASentimental) to extract depression, anxiety and stress from written text.
First, we trained the model to spot how sequences of recalled emotion words by
$N=200$ individuals correlated with their responses to the Depression Anxiety
Stress Scale (DASS-21). Within the framework of cognitive network science, we
model every list of recalled emotions as a walk over a networked mental
representation of semantic memory, with emotions connected according to free
associations in people's memory. Among several tested machine learning
approaches, we find that a multilayer perceptron neural network trained on word
sequences and semantic network distances can achieve state-of-art,
cross-validated predictions for depression ($R = 0.7$), anxiety ($R = 0.44$)
and stress ($R = 0.52$). Though limited by sample size, this first-of-its-kind
approach enables quantitative explorations of key semantic dimensions behind
DAS levels. We find that semantic distances between recalled emotions and the
dyad ""sad-happy"" are crucial features for estimating depression levels but are
less important for anxiety and stress. We also find that semantic distance of
recalls from ""fear"" can boost the prediction of anxiety but it becomes
redundant when the ""sad-happy"" dyad is considered. Adopting DASentimental as a
semi-supervised learning tool to estimate DAS in text, we apply it to a dataset
of 142 suicide notes. We conclude by discussing key directions for future

proper loading, noise rejection, filtering, and phase of the TENG signals along

detectors open up new tests of modified gravity theories in the strong-field
and dynamical, extreme gravity regime. Such tests rely sensitively on the phase
evolution of the gravitational waves, which is controlled by the
energy-momentum carried by such waves out of the system. We here study four
different methods for finding the gravitational wave stress-energy
pseudo-tensor in gravity theories with any combination of scalar, vector, or
tensor degrees of freedom. These methods rely on the second variation of the
action under short-wavelength averaging, the second perturbation of the field
equations in the short-wavelength approximation, the construction of an energy
complex leading to a Landau-Lifshitz tensor, and the use of Noether's theorem
in field theories about a flat background. We apply these methods in General
Relativity, scalar-tensor theories and Einstein-\AE{}ther theory to find the
gravitational wave stress-energy pseudo-tensor and calculate the rate at which
energy and linear momentum is carried away from the system. The stress-energy
tensor and the rate of linear momentum loss in Einstein-\AE{}ther theory are
presented here for the first time. We find that all methods yield the same rate
of energy loss, although the stress-energy pseudo-tensor can be functionally
different. We also find that the Noether method yields a stress-energy tensor
that is not symmetric or gauge-invariant, and symmetrization via the Belinfante
procedure does not fix these problems because this procedure relies on Lorentz
invariance, which is spontaneously broken in Einstein-\AE{}ther theory. The
methods and results found here will be useful for the calculation of
predictions in modified gravity theories that can then be contrasted with

  Hyperarousal Events","['Mahnoosh Sadeghi', 'Farzan Sasangohar', 'Anthony D McDonald']","Post Traumatic Stress Disorder is a psychiatric condition experienced by
individuals after exposure to a traumatic event. Prior work has shown promise
in detecting PTSD using physiological data such as heart rate. Despite the
promise shown by the machine learning based algorithms for PTSD, the validation
approaches used in previous research largely rely on theoretical and
computational validation methods rather than naturalistic evaluations that
account for users perceived precision and validity. Previous research has shown
that users perceptions of physiological changes may not always align well with
automated detection of such variables and such misalignment may lead to
distrust in automated detection which may affect adoption or sustainable usage
of such technologies. Therefore, the goal of this article is to investigate the
perceived precision of the PTSD hyperarousal detection tool (developed
previously) in a home study with a group of PTSD patients. Naturalistic
evaluation of such data driven algorithms may provide foundational insight into
the efficacy of such tools for non intrusive and cost efficient remote
monitoring of PTSD symptoms and will pave the way for their future adoption and
sustainable use. The results showed over sixty five percent of perceived

Our result is thus consistent with shear rupture as the source mechanism for
low-frequency earthquakes, and suggests that they obey to a similar physics of

pool of physiological signals using Quantum Annealing (QA). As a case study, we
will investigate the effectiveness of QA-based feature selection techniques in
selecting the optimal feature subset for stress detection. Features are
extracted from four signal sources: foot EDA, hand EDA, ECG, and respiration.
The proposed method embeds the feature variables extracted from the
physiological signals in a binary quadratic model. The bias of the feature
variable is calculated using the Pearson correlation coefficient between the
feature variable and the target variable. The weight of the edge connecting the
two feature variables is calculated using the Pearson correlation coefficient
between two feature variables in the binary quadratic model. Subsequently,
D-Wave's clique sampler is used to sample cliques from the binary quadratic
model. The underlying solution is then re-sampled to obtain multiple good
solutions and the clique with the lowest energy is returned as the optimal
solution. The proposed method is compared with commonly used feature selection
techniques for stress detection. Results indicate that QA-based feature subset
selection performed equally as that of classical techniques. However, under
data uncertainty conditions such as limited training data, the performance of
quantum annealing for selecting optimum features remained unaffected, whereas a
significant decrease in performance is observed with classical feature
selection techniques. Preliminary results show the promise of quantum annealing

analyzed during the stress-induced collapse of porous berlinite, AlPO4,
containing up to 50 vol% porosity. Stress collapse occurs in a series of
individual events (avalanches), and each avalanche leads to a jerk in sample
compression with corresponding acoustic emission (AE) signals. The distribution
of AE avalanche energies can be approximately described by a power law over a
large stress interval. We observed several collapse mechanisms whereby less
porous minerals show the superposition of independent jerks, which were not
related to the major collapse at the failure stress. In highly porous berlinite
(40% and 50%) an increase of the energy emission occurred near the failure
point. In contrast, the less porous samples did not show such an increase in
energy emission. Instead, in the near vicinity of the main failure point they
showed a reduction in the energy exponent to ~ 1.4, which is consistent with
the value reported for compressed porous systems displaying critical behavior.
This indicated that a critical avalanche regime with a lack of precursor events
occurs. In this case, all preceding large events were false alarms and
unrelated to the main failure event. Our results identify a method to use
pico-seismicity detection of foreshocks to warn of mine collapse before the

foreshock occurrence prior to natural earthquakes, making thus difficult to
track how earthquakes start. Here, we report on three stick-slip experiments
performed on cylindrical samples of Indian metagabbro under upper crustal
stress conditions (30-60 $MPa$). Acoustic emissions (AEs) were continuously
recorded by 8 calibrated acoustic sensors during the experiments. Seismological
parameters (moment magnitude, corner frequency and stress-drop) of the detected
AEs ($-8.8 \leq Mw \leq -7 $) follow the scaling law between moment magnitude
and corner frequency that characterizes natural earthquakes. AE activity always
increases towards failure and is found to be driven by along fault slip
velocity. Consistently for all three experiments, the stacked AE foreshock
sequences follow an inverse power-law of the time to failure (inverse Omori),
with a characteristic Omori time $c$ inversely proportional to normal stress.
AEs moment magnitudes increase towards failure, as manifested by a decrease in
b-value from $\sim 1$ to $\sim 0.5$ at the end of the nucleation process.
During nucleation, the averaged distance of foreshocks to mainshock also
continuously decreases, highlighting the fast migration of foreshocks towards
the mainshock epicenter location, and stabilizing at a distance from the latter
compatible with the predicted Rate-and-State nucleation size. Importantly, we
also show that the nucleation characteristic timescale scales inversely with
applied normal stress and the expected nucleation size. Finally, the seismic
component of the nucleation phase is orders of magnitude smaller than that of
its aseismic component, which suggests that, in this experimental setting at
least, foreshocks are the byproducts of a process almost fully aseismic.",2021,http://arxiv.org/abs/2105.04298v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.04298v2

  apparent friction velocity reduction and roughness length enhancement",['Miguel A. C. Teixeira'],"A simple analytical model is developed for the current induced by the wind
and modified by surface wind-waves in the oceanic surface layer, based on a
first-order turbulence closure and including the effect of a vortex force
representing the Stokes drift of the waves. The shear stress is partitioned
between a component due to shear in the current, which is reduced at low
turbulent Langmuir number ($La_t$), and a wave-induced component, which decays
over a depth proportional to the dominant wavelength. The model reproduces the
apparent reduction of the friction velocity and enhancement of the roughness
length estimated from current profiles, detected in a number of studies. These
effects are predicted to intensify as $La_t$ decreases, and are entirely
attributed to non-breaking surface waves. The current profile becomes flatter
for low $La_t$ owing to a smaller fraction of the total shear stress being
supported by the current shear. Comparisons of the model with the comprehensive
dataset provided by the laboratory experiments of Cheung and Street show
encouraging agreement, with the current speed decreasing as the wind speed
increases (corresponding to decreasing $La_t$), if the model is adjusted to
reflect the effects of a full wave spectrum on the intensity and depth of
penetration of the wave-induced stress. A version of the model where the shear
stress decreases to zero over a depth consistent with the measurements
accurately predicts the surface current speed. These results contribute towards

to determine the height of CBPs in 19.3 nm channel. Results. Best fit solar
rotation profile is given by $\omega(b)=(14.4060\pm0.0051 +
(-1.662\pm0.050)\sin^{2}b + (-2.742\pm0.081)\sin^{4}b)${\degr} day$^{-1}$.
Height of CBPs in SDO/AIA 19.3 nm channel was found to be $\approx$6500 km.
Meridional motion is predominantly poleward for all latitudes, while solar
velocity residuals show signs of torsional oscillations. Horizontal Reynolds
stress was found to be small compared to similar works, but still showing
transfer of angular momentum towards the solar equator. Conclusion. Most of the
results are consistent with Doppler measurements rather than tracer
measurements. Fairly small calculated value of horizontal Reynolds stress might
be due to the particular phase of the solar cycle. Accuracy of the calculated
rotation profile indicates that it is possible to measure changes in the
profile as the solar cycle evolves. Analysis of further SDO/AIA CBP data will
also help in better understanding of the temporal behaviour of the rotation
velocity residuals, meridional motions and Reynolds stress.",2016,http://arxiv.org/abs/1601.02406v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1601.02406v1
stress detection,"Longitudinal wall shear stress evaluation using centerline projection
  approach in the numerical simulations of the patient-based carotid artery","['Kevin Richter', 'Tristan Probst', 'Anna Hundertmark', 'Pepe Eulzer', 'Kai Lawonn']","In this numerical study areas of the carotid bifurcation and of a distal
stenosis in the internal carotid artery are closely observed to evaluate the
patient's current risks of ischemic stroke. An indicator for the vessel wall
defects is the stress the blood is exerting on the surrounding vessel tissue,
expressed standardly by the amplitude of the wall shear stress vector (WSS) and
its oscillatory shear index. In contrast, our orientation-based shear
evaluation detects negative shear stresses corresponding with reversal flow
appearing in low shear areas. In our investigations of longitudinal component
of the wall shear vector, tangential vectors aligned longitudinally with the
vessel are necessary. However, as a result of stenosed regions and imaging
segmentation techniques from patients' CTA scans, the geometry model's mesh is
non-smooth on its surface areas and the automatically generated tangential
vector field is discontinuous and multi-directional, making an interpretation
of the orientation-based risk indicators unreliable. We improve the evaluation
of longitudinal shear stress by applying the projection of the vessel's
center-line to the surface to construct smooth tangetial field aligned
longitudinaly with the vessel. We validate our approach for the longitudinal
WSS component and the corresponding oscillatory index by comparing them to
results obtained using automatically generated tangents in both rigid and
elastic vessel modeling as well as to amplitude based indicators. The major
benefit of our WSS evaluation based on its longitudinal component for the
cardiovascular risk assessment is the detection of negative WSS indicating
persitent reversal flow. This is impossible in the case of the amplitude-based
WSS.",2022,http://arxiv.org/abs/2204.04018v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.04018v3

ensuring the system stability. However, it is usually complex and has to be

Specifically, we first present the framework of LSTM-based anomaly detection in
non-linear dynamical system, including data preprocessing, multi-step
prediction and anomaly detection. According to the prediction requirement, two
types of training modes are explored in multi-step prediction, where samples in
a wall shear stress dataset are collected by an adaptive sliding window. On the
basis of the multi-step prediction result, a Local Average with Adaptive
Parameters (LAAP) algorithm is proposed to extract local numerical features of
the time sequence and estimate the upcoming anomaly. The experimental results
show that our proposed multi-step prediction method can achieve a higher
prediction accuracy than traditional method in wall shear stress dataset, and
the LAAP algorithm performs better than the absolute value-based method in

  behavior of composite hydrogels","['I. V. Gofman', 'A. L. Buyanov']","An unusual type of mechanical behavior was registered while studying the
swollen hydrogel compositions ""cellulose-polyacrylamide"" in the conditions of
multiple cyclic compression tests with the broad variation of the deformation
speed. While increasing the deformation speed the clearly seen inversion of the
positions of compression and decompression parts of the cyclic stress-strain
curves was detected. While carrying out the cyclic compression tests with
relatively low deformation speed (about 100-200 % of the initial sample's
height per minute) the well defined hysteresis of the stress-strain curve can
de seen and in these conditions the decompression part of the curve is situated
inferior the part corresponding to compression. But while increasing the speed
of the deformation the tendency to the progressive approach of the compression
and decompression curves to each other is clearly seen. This effect results in
the full disappearance of the hysteresis at some value of the deformation
speed: the decompression curve coincides with the compression curve. Along with
the further increase of the deformation speed the hysteresis appears again but
the curve corresponding to compression process is situated inferior the curve
corresponding to decompression: the ""inversion"" of the hysteresis was detected.
The precise character of this process depends upon the stiffness of the

  Detection on Social Media","['Lei Cao', 'Huijun Zhang', 'Ling Feng']","A large number of individuals are suffering from suicidal ideation in the
world. There are a number of causes behind why an individual might suffer from

  Smartwatch Physiological and Activity Data","['Mahnoosh Sadeghi', 'Anthony D McDonald', 'Farzan Sasangohar']","Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) is a psychiatric condition affecting
nearly a quarter of the United States war veterans who return from war zones.
Treatment for PTSD typically consists of a combination of in-session therapy
and medication. However; patients often experience their most severe PTSD
symptoms outside of therapy sessions. Mobile health applications may address
this gap, but their effectiveness is limited by the current gap in continuous
monitoring and detection capabilities enabling timely intervention. The goal of
this article is to develop a novel method to detect hyperarousal events using
physiological and activity-based machine learning algorithms. Physiological
data including heart rate and body acceleration as well as self-reported
hyperarousal events were collected using a tool developed for commercial
off-the-shelf wearable devices from 99 United States veterans diagnosed with
PTSD over several days. The data were used to develop four machine learning
algorithms: Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, Logistic Regression and
XGBoost. The XGBoost model had the best performance in detecting onset of PTSD
symptoms with over 83% accuracy and an AUC of 0.70. Post-hoc SHapley Additive
exPlanations (SHAP) additive explanation analysis showed that algorithm
predictions were correlated with average heart rate, minimum heart rate and
average body acceleration. Findings show promise in detecting onset of PTSD

stress detection,Long-term stream evolution in tidal disruption events,"['Clément Bonnerot', 'Elena M. Rossi', 'Giuseppe Lodato']","A large number of tidal disruption event (TDE) candidates have been observed
recently, often differing in their observational features. Two classes appear
to stand out: X-ray and optical TDEs, the latter featuring lower effective
temperatures and luminosities. These differences can be explained if the
radiation detected from the two categories of events originates from different
locations. In practice, this location is set by the evolution of the debris
stream around the black hole and by the energy dissipation associated with it.
In this paper, we build an analytical model for the stream evolution, whose
dynamics is determined by both magnetic stresses and shocks. Without magnetic
stresses, the stream always circularizes. The ratio of the circularization
timescale to the initial stream period is $t_{\rm ev}/t_{\rm min} = 8.3 (M_{\rm
h}/10^6 M_{\odot})^{-5/3} \beta^{-3}$, where $M_{\rm h}$ is the black hole mass
and $\beta$ is the penetration factor. If magnetic stresses are strong, they
can lead to the stream ballistic accretion. The boundary between
circularization and ballistic accretion corresponds to a critical magnetic
stresses efficiency $v_{\rm A}/v_{\rm c} \approx 10^{-1}$, largely independent
of $M_{\rm h}$ and $\beta$. However, the main effect of magnetic stresses is to
accelerate the stream evolution by strengthening self-crossing shocks.
Ballistic accretion therefore necessarily occurs on the stream dynamical
timescale. The shock luminosity associated to energy dissipation is
sub-Eddington but decays as $t^{-5/3}$ only for a slow stream evolution.
Finally, we find that the stream thickness rapidly increases if the stream is
unable to cool completely efficiently. A likely outcome is its fast evolution
into a thick torus, or even an envelope completely surrounding the black hole.",2016,http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.00970v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1608.00970v2

layer near the surface of comet 67P/Churyumov--Gerasimenko with a
thermo-viscoelastic model. Such a layer could be formed by the recondensation
or sintering of water ice (and dust grains), as suggested by laboratory
experiments and computer simulations, and would explain the high compressive
strength encountered by experiments on board the Philae lander. Changes in
temperature from seasonal insolation variation penetrate into the comet's
surface to depths controlled by the thermal inertia, causing the material to
expand and contract. Modelling this with a Maxwellian viscoelastic response on
a spherical nucleus, we show that a hard, icy layer with similar properties to
Martian permafrost will experience high stresses: up to tens of MPa, which
exceed its material strength (a few MPa), down to depths of centimetres to a
metre. The stress distribution with latitude is confirmed qualitatively when
taking into account the comet's complex shape but neglecting thermal inertia.
Stress is found to be comparable to the material strength everywhere for
sufficient thermal inertia ($\gtrsim50$ J m$^{-2}$ K$^{-1}$ s$^{-1/2}$) and ice
content ($\gtrsim 45\%$ at the equator). In this case, stresses penetrate to a
typical depth of $\sim0.25$ m, consistent with the detection of metre-scale
thermal contraction crack polygons all over the comet. Thermal fracturing may
be an important erosion process on cometary surfaces which breaks down material

the COVID-19 pandemic on different aspects of the general population's lives,
few studies are focused on the LGBTQ population. In this paper, we develop and
evaluate two sets of machine learning classifiers using a pre-pandemic and a

their sexual and gender identities. We demonstrate that our best pre- and

minority stress posts across pre- and during-pandemic periods. We find that
anger words are strongly associated with minority stress during the COVID-19

causal analysis. The results show that the LGBTQ population have a greater
increase in the usage of cognitive words and worsened observable attribute in

signalling responses developing cellular memory. In cellular learning nodes of
signalling networks strengthen their interactions e.g. by the conformational
memory of intrinsically disordered proteins, protein translocation, miRNAs,
lncRNAs, chromatin memory and signalling cascades. This can be described by a
generalized, unicellular Hebbian learning process, where those signalling
connections, which participate in learning, become stronger. Here we review
those scenarios, where cellular signalling is not only repeated in a few times
(when learning occurs), but becomes too frequent, too large, or too complex and
overloads the cell. This leads to desensitisation of signalling networks by
decoupling signalling components, receptor internalization, and consequent
downregulation. These molecular processes are examples of anti-Hebbian learning
and forgetting of signalling networks. Stress can be perceived as signalling
overload inducing the desensitisation of signalling pathways. Aging occurs by
the summative effects of cumulative stress downregulating signalling. We
propose that cellular learning desensitisation, stress and aging may be placed
along the same axis of more and more intensive (prolonged or repeated)
signalling. We discuss how cells might discriminate between repeated and
unexpected signals, and highlight the Hebbian and anti-Hebbian mechanisms
behind the fold-change detection in the NF-\k{appa}B signalling pathway. We
list drug design methods using Hebbian learning (such as chemically-induced
proximity) and clinical treatment modalities inducing (cancer, drug allergies)

measured using a laser-optics based curvature setup, whereas glancing angle
X-ray diffraction was employed to quantify the surface stress; this also
allowed studying role of out-of-plane stress gradient in whisker growth. Both
bulk stress and surface stress in Sn coating evolved with time, wherein both
were compressive immediately after the deposition, and thereafter while the
bulk stress monotonically became more compressive and subsequently saturated
with aging at room temperature, the stress near the surface of the Sn coating
continually became more tensile with aging. These opposing evolutionary
behaviors of bulk and surface stresses readily established a negative
out-of-plane stress gradient, required for spontaneous growth of whiskers. The
importance of out-of-plane stress gradient was also validated by externally
imposing widely different stress states and stress gradients in Sn coatings
using a 3-point bending apparatus. It was consistently observed that whisker
growth was more in the coatings under external tensile stress, however, with
higher negative out-of-plane stress gradient. The results conclusively indicate

  transfer learning","['Ergin Isleyen', 'Sebnem Duzgun', 'McKell R. Carter']","Roof falls due to geological conditions are major safety hazards in mining
and tunneling industries, causing lost work times, injuries, and fatalities.
Several large-opening limestone mines in the Eastern and Midwestern United
States have roof fall problems caused by high horizontal stresses. The typical
hazard management approach for this type of roof fall hazard relies heavily on
visual inspections and expert knowledge. In this study, we propose an
artificial intelligence (AI) based system for the detection roof fall hazards
caused by high horizontal stresses. We use images depicting hazardous and
non-hazardous roof conditions to develop a convolutional neural network for
autonomous detection of hazardous roof conditions. To compensate for limited
input data, we utilize a transfer learning approach. In transfer learning, an
already-trained network is used as a starting point for classification in a
similar domain. Results confirm that this approach works well for classifying
roof conditions as hazardous or safe, achieving a statistical accuracy of 86%.
However, accuracy alone is not enough to ensure a reliable hazard management
system. System constraints and reliability are improved when the features being
used by the network are understood. Therefore, we used a deep learning
interpretation technique called integrated gradients to identify the important
geologic features in each image for prediction. The analysis of integrated
gradients shows that the system mimics expert judgment on roof fall hazard
detection. The system developed in this paper demonstrates the potential of
deep learning in geological hazard management to complement human experts, and
likely to become an essential part of autonomous tunneling operations in those
cases where hazard identification heavily depends on expert knowledge.",2020,http://arxiv.org/abs/2012.03681v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.03681v1
stress detection,Vision based body gesture meta features for Affective Computing,['Indigo J. D. Orton'],"Early detection of psychological distress is key to effective treatment.
Automatic detection of distress, such as depression, is an active area of
research. Current approaches utilise vocal, facial, and bodily modalities. Of
these, the bodily modality is the least investigated, partially due to the
difficulty in extracting bodily representations from videos, and partially due
to the lack of viable datasets. Existing body modality approaches use automatic
categorization of expressions to represent body language as a series of
specific expressions, much like words within natural language. In this
dissertation I present a new type of feature, within the body modality, that
represents meta information of gestures, such as speed, and use it to predict a
non-clinical depression label. This differs to existing work by representing
overall behaviour as a small set of aggregated meta features derived from a
person's movement. In my method I extract pose estimation from videos, detect
gestures within body parts, extract meta information from individual gestures,
and finally aggregate these features to generate a small feature vector for use
in prediction tasks. I introduce a new dataset of 65 video recordings of
interviews with self-evaluated distress, personality, and demographic labels.
This dataset enables the development of features utilising the whole body in
distress detection tasks. I evaluate my newly introduced meta-features for
predicting depression, anxiety, perceived stress, somatic stress, five standard
personality measures, and gender. A linear regression based classifier using
these features achieves a 82.70% F1 score for predicting depression within my

applications in physical, biological, and social sciences by identifying
mesoscopic groups based on the links between individual units. Moreover,
community detection approaches have been generalized to various data analysis
tasks by constructing networks whose links depend on individual units'
measurements. However, identifying well-separated subpopulations in data sets,
e.g., multimodality, still presents challenges as both community detection with
existing null models and other partition methods either fail to give partitions
that correspond to dips in the data or give partitions that do not correspond
to dips in the data. Here we introduce a new spatially informed null model for
this task that takes into account spatial structure but does not explicitly
depend on distances between measurements. We find that community detection
using this null model successfully identifies subpopulations in multimodal data
and accurately does not for unimodal data. This new method represents a
complement to statistical methods, as we treat data directly using a network
science approach. We apply this new null model to first distinguish interphase

Here we take the stress field as given and consider the problem of
approximating any such stress field, in a given body, as a linear combination
of predetermined fields which can serve as a basis. We consider planar stress
states in detail, and introduce an extremization problem that leads to a linear
eigenvalue problem. Eigenfunctions of that problem form an orthonormal basis
for all possible residual stress states of sufficient smoothness. In numerical
examples, convergence of the approximating stress fields is demonstrated in the
$L^2$ norm for continuous stress fields as well as for a stress field with a
simple discontinuity. Finally, we outline the extension of our theory to three

  long-range bond-orientational ordering in a model liquid",['V. A. Levashov'],"Recently there have been several considerations by different authors of
viscosity and the Green-Kubo stress correlation function from the microscopic
perspective. In most of these and earlier works the atomic level stress is the
minimal element of stress. It is also possible to consider, for pairwise
interaction potentials, as the minimal elements of stress, the stress tensors
associated with the pairs of interacting particles. From this perspective, the
atomic level stress is not the minimal stress element, but a sum of all pair
stress elements in which involved a selected particle. In this paper, we
consider the Green-Kubo stress correlation function from a microscopic
perspective using the stress tensors of interacting pairs as the basic stress
elements. The obtained results show the presence of a long-range
bond-orientational order in the studied model liquid and naturally elucidate
the connection of the bond-orientational order with viscosity. It turns out
that the long-range bond-orientational order is more clearly expressed in the
pairs' stress correlation function than in the atomic stress correlation
function. On the other hand, previously observed stress waves are much better
expressed in the atomic stress correlation functions. We also address the close
connection of our approach with the previous bond-orientational order
considerations. Finally, we consider the probability distributions for the
bond-stress and atomic stress correlation products at selected distances. The
character of the obtained probability distributions raises questions about the
meaning of the average correlation functions at large distances.",2018,http://arxiv.org/abs/1807.03552v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1807.03552v2

(CMB) and large-scale structure (LSS) probe various inhomogeneous properties of
the dark sectors (including neutrinos, dark matter, and dark energy). We
stress, and quantify by simple formulas, that the primary CMB anisotropies are
very susceptible to the gravitational potentials during horizon entry, less at
recombination. The CMB thus allows us to scan \Phi+\Psi and the underlying dark
kinetics for all redshifts z~1-10^5. LSS, on the other hand, responds strongest
to \Phi at low redshifts. Dark perturbations are often parameterized by the
anisotropic stress and effective sound speed (stiffness). We find that the dark
anisotropic stress and stiffness influence the visible species at the
correspondingly early and late stages of horizon entry, and affect stronger
respectively the CMB and LSS. The CMB yet remains essential to probing the
stiff perturbations of light neutrinos and dark energy, detectable only during
horizon entry. The clustering of dark species and large propagation speed of
their inhomogeneities also map to distinctive features in the CMB and LSS. -Any
parameterization of the signatures of dark kinetics that assumes general
relativity can effectively accommodate any modified gravity (MG) that retains
the equivalence principle for the visible sectors. This implies that formally
the nonstandard structure growth or \Phi/\Psi ratio, while indicative, are not
definitive MG signatures. The definitive signatures of MG may include the
strong dependence of the apparent dark dynamics on visible species, its
superluminality, and the nonstandard phenomenology of gravitational waves.",2007,http://arxiv.org/abs/0707.0692v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/0707.0692v1

  bacterial metabolism","['Oriol Güell', 'Francesc Sagués', 'M. Ángeles Serrano']","We studied in silico effects of structural stress in Mycoplasma pneumoniae, a
genome-reduced model bacterial organism, by tracking the damage propagating on
its metabolic network after a deleterious perturbation. First, we analyzed
failure cascades spreading from individual reactions and pairs of reactions and
compared the results to those in Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli. To
alert to the potential damage caused by the failure of individual reactions, we
propose a generic predictor based on local information that identifies target
reactions for structural vulnerability. With respect to the simultaneous
failure of pairs of reactions, we detected strong non-linear amplification
effects that can be predicted by the presence of specific motifs in the
intersection of single cascades. We further connected the metabolic and gene
co-expression networks of M. pneumoniae through enzyme activities, and studied
the consequences of knocking out individual genes and clusters of genes. Damage
caused by single gene knockouts reveals a strong correlation between
genome-scale cascades of large impact and gene essentiality. At the same time,
we found that genes controlling high-damage reactions tend to operate in
functional isolation, as a metabolic protection mechanism. We conclude that the
architecture of M. pneumoniae, both at the level of metabolism and genome,
seems to have evolved towards increased structural robustness, similarly to
other more complex model bacterial organisms, despite its reduced genome size
and its greater metabolic network linearity. Our approach, although motivated
biochemically, is generic enough to be of potential use toward analyzing and

stress-time curves obtained from compressive constant strain-rate tests on two
metallic glass samples with different ductility levels in an effort to extract
hidden information in the seemingly irregular serrations. Two distinct types of
dynamics are detected in these two alloy samples. The stress-strain curve
corresponding to the less ductile $Zr_{65}Cu_{15}Ni_{10}Al_{10}$ alloy is shown
to exhibit finite correlation dimension and a positive Lyapunov exponent,
suggesting that the underlying dynamics is chaotic. In contrast, for the more

magnitudes and their time durations obey a power law scaling reminiscent of a
self-organized critical state. The exponents also satisfy the scaling relation
compatible with self-organized criticality. Possible physical mechanisms
contributing to the two distinct dynamic regimes are discussed by drawing on
the analogy with the serrated yielding of crystalline samples. The analysis,
together with some physical reasoning, suggests that plasticity in the less

correlated with size effects in strength and with a step-like plastic response
under uniaxial compression and tension. Yielding and plastic flow in these
samples is often accompanied by the emergence of multiple dislocation
avalanches. Dislocations might be active pre-yield, but their activity
typically cannot be discerned because of the inherent instrumental noise in
detecting equipment. We apply Alternate Current (AC) load perturbations via
Dynamic Mechanical Analysis (DMA) during quasi-static uniaxial compression
experiments on single crystalline Cu nano-pillars with diameters of 500 nm, and
compute dynamic moduli at frequencies 0.1, 0.3, 1, and 10 Hz under
progressively higher static loads until yielding. By tracking the collective
aspects of the oscillatory stress-strain-time series in multiple samples, we
observe an evolving dissipative component of the dislocation network response
that signifies the transition from elastic behavior to dislocation avalanches
in the globally pre-yield regime. We postulate that microplasticity, which is
associated with the combination of dislocation avalanches and slow viscoplastic
relaxations, is the cause of the dependency of dynamic modulus on the driving
rate and the quasi-static stress. We construct a continuum mesoscopic

  Imaging","['Cameron Hoerig', 'Jamshid Ghaboussi', 'Michael F. Insana']","Elasticity images map biomechanical properties of soft tissues to aid in the
detection and diagnosis of pathological states. In particular, quasi-static
ultrasonic (US) elastography techniques use force-displacement measurements
acquired during an US scan to parameterize the spatio-temporal stress-strain
behavior. Current methods use a model-based inverse approach to estimate the
parameters associated with a chosen constitutive model. However, model-based
methods rely on simplifying assumptions of tissue biomechanical properties,
often limiting elastography to imaging one or two linear-elastic parameters.
  We previously described a data-driven method for building neural network
constitutive models (NNCMs) that learn stress-strain relationships from
force-displacement data. Using measurements acquired on gelatin phantoms, we
demonstrated the ability of NNCMs to characterize linear-elastic mechanical
properties without an initial model assumption and thus circumvent the
mathematical constraints typically encountered in classic model-based
approaches to the inverse problem. While successful, we were required to use a
priori knowledge of the internal object shape to define the spatial
distribution of regions exhibiting different material properties.
  Here, we introduce Cartesian neural network constitutive models (CaNNCMs)
that are capable of using data to model both linear-elastic mechanical
properties and their distribution in space. We demonstrate the ability of
CaNNCMs to capture arbitrary material property distributions using
stress-strain data from simulated phantoms. Furthermore, we show that a trained

shear in a quasi-two-dimensional system, we measure the mechanical response
when we reduce the strain amplitude after the initial oscillations with a
larger strain amplitude. Here, we find the existence of the shear-jammed state
under this protocol in which the storage modulus $G^{\prime}$ is only finite
for high initial strain amplitude $\gamma_0^{I}$. We also find the existence of
the fragile state in which both fluid-like and solid-like responses can be

$\gamma_0^{I}$ depending on the initial phase $\Theta$ (or the asymmetricity of
the applied strain) of the oscillatory shear. We also observe the DST-like
behavior under the oscillatory shear in the fragile state. Moreover, we find
that the stress anisotropy becomes large in the fragile state. Finally, we

of a model glass subjected to thermal cycling are investigated using molecular
dynamics simulations. We study a non-additive binary mixture which is annealed
with different cooling rates from the liquid phase to a low temperature well

heating and cooling the system at constant pressure, thus temporarily inducing
internal stresses upon thermal expansion. We find that poorly annealed glasses
are relocated to progressively lower levels of potential energy over
consecutive cycles, whereas well annealed glasses can be rejuvenated at
sufficiently large amplitudes of thermal cycling. Moreover, the lowest levels
of potential energy after one hundred cycles are detected at a certain
temperature amplitude for all cooling rates. The structural transition to
different energy states is accompanied by collective nonaffine displacements of
atoms that are organized into clusters, whose typical size becomes larger with
increasing cooling rate or temperature amplitude. We show that the elastic
modulus and the peak value of the stress overshoot exhibit distinct maxima at
the cycling amplitude, which corresponds to the minimum of the potential
energy. The simulation results indicate that the yielding peak as a function of
the cycling amplitude for quickly annealed glasses represents a lower bound for

processes. Thus, there is limited experimental evidence of displacive motion
mediated structural transformations. Here, we report the high-pressure
structural transformation of 6 nm Au nanocrystals under nonhydrostatic pressure

transformation of multiply twinned nanocrystals into single crystalline

twinned state after redispersion in toluene solvent. The dynamics of recovery
was captured using transmission electron microscopy which showed that the
recovery was governed by surface recrystallization and rapid twin boundary
motion. We show that this transformation is energetically favorable by
calculating the pressure-induced change in strain energy. Molecular dynamics

stress detection,"Identifying Stress Responsive Genes using Overlapping Communities in
  Co-expression Networks","['Camila Riccio', 'Jorge Finke', 'Camilo Rocha']","This paper proposes a workflow to identify genes that respond to specific
treatments in plants. The workflow takes as input the RNA sequencing read
counts and phenotypical data of different genotypes, measured under control and
treatment conditions. It outputs a reduced group of genes marked as relevant
for treatment response. Technically, the proposed approach is both a
generalization and an extension of WGCNA. It aims to identify specific modules
of overlapping communities underlying the co-expression network of genes.
Module detection is achieved by using Hierarchical Link Clustering. The
overlapping nature of the systems' regulatory domains that generate
co-expression can be identified by such modules. LASSO regression is employed
to analyze phenotypic responses of modules to treatment.
  Results. The workflow is applied to rice (Oryza sativa), a major food source
known to be highly sensitive to salt stress. The workflow identifies 19 rice
genes that seem relevant in the response to salt stress. They are distributed
across 6 modules: 3 modules, each grouping together 3 genes, are associated to
shoot K content; 2 modules of 3 genes are associated to shoot biomass; and 1
module of 4 genes is associated to root biomass. These genes represent target
genes for the improvement of salinity tolerance in rice.
  Conclusion. A more effective framework to reduce the search-space for target
genes that respond to a specific treatment is introduced. It facilitates
experimental validation by restraining efforts to a smaller subset of genes of
high potential relevance.",2020,http://arxiv.org/abs/2011.03526v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.03526v2

  a modified hollow fibre bioreactor","['Stephen G Gray', 'Peter D Weinberg']","Effects of mechanical stress on the permeability of vascular endothelium are
important to normal physiology and may be critical in the development of
atherosclerosis, where they can account for the patchy arterial distribution of
the disease. Such properties are frequently investigated in vitro. Here we
evaluate and use the hollow fibre bioreactor for this purpose; in this system,
endothelial cells form a confluent monolayer lining numerous plastic
capillaries with porous walls, contained in a cartridge. The capillaries were
perfused with a near-aortic waveform by an external pump, and permeability was
assessed by the movement of rhodamine-labelled albumin from the intracapillary
space to the extracapillary space. Confluence and quiescence of the cells was
confirmed by electron microscopy and measurements of glucose consumption and
permeability. The system was able to detect previously established influences
on permeability: tracer transport was increased by acute application of shear
stress and decreased by chronic shear stress compared to a static control, and
was increased by thrombin or an NO synthase inhibitor under chronic shear.
Increasing viscosity by addition of xanthan gum reduced permeability under both
acute and chronic shear. Addition of damping chambers to reduce flow
pulsatility increased permeability. Modifying the cartridge to allow chronic
convection across the monolayer increased effective permeability more than
could be explained the addition of convective transport alone, indicating that
it caused an increase in permeability. The off-the-shelf hollow fibre
bioreactor provides an excellent system for investigating the biomechanics of
endothelial permeability and its potential is increased by simple
modifications.",2023,http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.01466v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.01466v1

nano-electro-mechanical systems (NEMS) such as nanomechanical resonators, which
have recently received significant attention from the scientific community.
This has not only been for their capability for the label-free detection of
bio/chemical-molecules at single-molecule (or atomic) resolution for future
applications such as the early diagnostics of diseases such as cancer, but also
for their unprecedented ability to detect physical quantities such as molecular
weight, elastic stiffness, surface stress, and surface elastic stiffness for
adsorbed molecules on the surface. Most experimental works on resonator-based
molecular detection have been based on the principle that molecular adsorption
onto a resonator surface increases the effective mass, and consequently
decreases the resonant frequencies of the nanomechanical resonator. However,
this principle is insufficient to provide fundamental insights into
resonator-based molecular detection at the nanoscale; this is due to recently
proposed novel nanoscale detection principles including various effects such as
surface effects, nonlinear oscillations, coupled resonance, and stiffness
effects. Therefore, our objective in this review is to overview the current
attempts to understand the underlying mechanisms in nanoresonator-based

that with the 6 and 7 $L$ band Keck/NIRSPEC epochs analyzed in the original

small number of epochs originally presented by running simulations both with
the upgraded NIRSPEC instrument and with near-zero primary velocities, as

applications. However, the potential for misuse of these models in activities
such as plagiarism, generating fake news, and spamming has raised concern about
their responsible use. Consequently, the reliable detection of AI-generated
text has become a critical area of research. AI text detectors have shown to be
effective under their specific settings. In this paper, we stress-test the
robustness of these AI text detectors in the presence of an attacker. We
introduce recursive paraphrasing attack to stress test a wide range of
detection schemes, including the ones using the watermarking as well as neural
network-based detectors, zero shot classifiers, and retrieval-based detectors.
Our experiments conducted on passages, each approximately 300 tokens long,
reveal the varying sensitivities of these detectors to our attacks. Our
findings indicate that while our recursive paraphrasing method can
significantly reduce detection rates, it only slightly degrades text quality in
many cases, highlighting potential vulnerabilities in current detection systems
in the presence of an attacker. Additionally, we investigate the susceptibility
of watermarked LLMs to spoofing attacks aimed at misclassifying human-written
text as AI-generated. We demonstrate that an attacker can infer hidden AI text
signatures without white-box access to the detection method, potentially
leading to reputational risks for LLM developers. Finally, we provide a

  Materials","['Yuming Huang', 'Karen E. Daniels']","Granular materials transmit stress via a network of force chains. Despite the
importance of these chains to characterizing the stress state and dynamics of
the system, there is no common framework for quantifying their their
properties. Recently, attention has turned to the tools of network science as a
promising route to such a description. In this paper, we apply community
detection techniques to numerically-generated packings of spheres over a range
of interparticle friction coefficients and confining pressures. In order to
extract chain-like features, we use a modularity maximization with a
recently-developed geographical null model \cite{Bassett2015}, and optimize the
technique to detect branched structures by minimizing the normalized convex
hull of the detected communities. We characterize the force chain communities
by their size (number of particles), network strength (internal forces), and
normalized convex hull ratio (sparseness). We find the that the first two
exhibit an approximately linear correlation and are therefore largely
redundant. For both pressure $P$ and interparticle friction $\mu$, we observe
crossovers in behavior. For $\mu \lesssim 0.1$, the packings exhibit more
sensitivity to pressure. In addition, we identify a crossover pressure where
the frictional dependence switches from having more large/strong communities at
low $\mu$ vs. high $\mu$. We explain these phenomena by comparison to the
spatial distribution of communities along the vertical axis of the system.
These results provide new tools for considering the mesoscale structure of a
granular system and pave the way for reduced descriptions based on the force

dislocations and disclinations in the framework of Mindlin's gradient
elasticity. We consider simple but rigorous versions of Mindlin's first
gradient elasticity with one material length (gradient coefficient). Using the
stress function method, we find modified stress functions for all six types of
Volterra defects (dislocations and disclinations) situated in an isotropic and
infinitely extended medium. By means of these stress functions, we obtain exact
analytical solutions for the stress and strain fields of dislocations and
disclinations. An advantage of these solutions for the elastic strain and
stress is that they have no singularities at the defect line. They are finite
and have maxima or minima in the defect core region. The stresses and strains
are either zero or have a finite maximum value at the defect line. The maximum
value of stresses may serve as a measure of the critical stress level when
fracture and failure may occur. Thus, both the stress and elastic strain
singularities are removed in such a simple gradient theory. In addition, we
give the relation to the nonlocal stresses in Eringen's nonlocal elasticity for

thermal expansion (CTE) mismatch-induced stress. CTE-mismatch-induced stress is
shown to dominate the compressive regime of the near-surface stress
distribution around Cu-filled TSV structures, while pre-existing stress
dominates the full range of the stress distribution in the CNT-filled TSV

decades. Owing to the touchless fabrication process compatible with modern

However, the deformations created by existing stress-control schemes are

generation and correction which are not achievable by conventional methods.

the resulting pressure while visualizing the spontaneous nucleation and growth
of alkali halide salts. The experiments reveal the crucial role of the wetting
films between the growing crystal and the confining walls for the development
of the pressure. The results suggest that the pressure originates from a charge
repulsion between the similarly charged wall and the crystal separated by a
~1.5 nm salt solution film. Consequently, if the walls are made hydrophobic, no
film and no crystallization pressure are detected. The magnitude of the

  Language Text","['Xinzhi Wang', 'Luyao Kou', 'Vijayan Sugumaran', 'Xiangfeng Luo', 'Hui Zhang']","Emotion analysis has been attracting researchers' attention. Most previous
works in the artificial intelligence field focus on recognizing emotion rather
than mining the reason why emotions are not or wrongly recognized. Correlation
among emotions contributes to the failure of emotion recognition. In this
paper, we try to fill the gap between emotion recognition and emotion
correlation mining through natural language text from web news. Correlation
among emotions, expressed as the confusion and evolution of emotion, is
primarily caused by human emotion cognitive bias. To mine emotion correlation
from emotion recognition through text, three kinds of features and two deep
neural network models are presented. The emotion confusion law is extracted
through orthogonal basis. The emotion evolution law is evaluated from three
perspectives, one-step shift, limited-step shifts, and shortest path transfer.
The method is validated using three datasets-the titles, the bodies, and the
comments of news articles, covering both objective and subjective texts in
varying lengths (long and short). The experimental results show that, in
subjective comments, emotions are easily mistaken as anger. Comments tend to
arouse emotion circulations of love-anger and sadness-anger. In objective news,
it is easy to recognize text emotion as love and cause fear-joy circulation.
That means, journalists may try to attract attention using fear and joy words
but arouse the emotion love instead; After news release, netizens generate
emotional comments to express their intense emotions, i.e., anger, sadness, and
love. These findings could provide insights for applications regarding

emotion recognition,Multimodal Local-Global Ranking Fusion for Emotion Recognition,"['Paul Pu Liang', 'Amir Zadeh', 'Louis-Philippe Morency']","Emotion recognition is a core research area at the intersection of artificial
intelligence and human communication analysis. It is a significant technical
challenge since humans display their emotions through complex idiosyncratic
combinations of the language, visual and acoustic modalities. In contrast to
traditional multimodal fusion techniques, we approach emotion recognition from
both direct person-independent and relative person-dependent perspectives. The
direct person-independent perspective follows the conventional emotion
recognition approach which directly infers absolute emotion labels from
observed multimodal features. The relative person-dependent perspective
approaches emotion recognition in a relative manner by comparing partial video
segments to determine if there was an increase or decrease in emotional
intensity. Our proposed model integrates these direct and relative prediction
perspectives by dividing the emotion recognition task into three easier
subtasks. The first subtask involves a multimodal local ranking of relative
emotion intensities between two short segments of a video. The second subtask
uses local rankings to infer global relative emotion ranks with a Bayesian
ranking algorithm. The third subtask incorporates both direct predictions from
observed multimodal behaviors and relative emotion ranks from local-global
rankings for final emotion prediction. Our approach displays excellent
performance on an audio-visual emotion recognition benchmark and improves over
other algorithms for multimodal fusion.",2018,http://arxiv.org/abs/1809.04931v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1809.04931v1

  self-reported client emotions to measure emotional coherence","['Neha Warikoo', 'Tobias Mayer', 'Dana Atzil-Slonim', 'Amir Eliassaf', 'Shira Haimovitz', 'Iryna Gurevych']","Emotions are experienced and expressed through various response systems.
Coherence between emotional experience and emotional expression is considered
important to clients' well being. To date, emotional coherence (EC) has been
studied at a single time point using lab-based tasks with relatively small
datasets. No study has examined EC between the subjective experience of
emotions and emotion expression in therapy or whether this coherence is
associated with clients' well being. Natural language Processing (NLP)
approaches have been applied to identify emotions from psychotherapy dialogue,
which can be implemented to study emotional processes on a larger scale.
However, these methods have yet to be used to study coherence between emotional
experience and emotional expression over the course of therapy and whether it
relates to clients' well-being. This work presents an end-to-end approach where
we use emotion predictions from our transformer based emotion recognition model
to study emotional coherence and its diagnostic potential in psychotherapy
research. We first employ our transformer based approach on a Hebrew
psychotherapy dataset to automatically label clients' emotions at utterance
level in psychotherapy dialogues. We subsequently investigate the emotional
coherence between clients' self-reported emotional states and our model-based
emotion predictions. We also examine the association between emotional
coherence and clients' well being. Our findings indicate a significant
correlation between clients' self-reported emotions and positive and negative
emotions expressed verbally during psychotherapy sessions. Coherence in
positive emotions was also highly correlated with clients well-being. These
results illustrate how NLP can be applied to identify important emotional
processes in psychotherapy to improve diagnosis and treatment for clients
suffering from mental-health problems.",2022,http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.12512v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.12512v1
emotion recognition,Modeling the Experience of Emotion,['Joost Broekens'],"Affective computing has proven to be a viable field of research comprised of
a large number of multidisciplinary researchers resulting in work that is
widely published. The majority of this work consists of computational models of
emotion recognition, computational modeling of causal factors of emotion and
emotion expression through rendered and robotic faces. A smaller part is
concerned with modeling the effects of emotion, formal modeling of cognitive
appraisal theory and models of emergent emotions. Part of the motivation for
affective computing as a field is to better understand emotional processes
through computational modeling. One of the four major topics in affective
computing is computers that have emotions (the others are recognizing,
expressing and understanding emotions). A critical and neglected aspect of
having emotions is the experience of emotion (Barrett, Mesquita, Ochsner, and
Gross, 2007): what does the content of an emotional episode look like, how does
this content change over time and when do we call the episode emotional. Few
modeling efforts have these topics as primary focus. The launch of a journal on
synthetic emotions should motivate research initiatives in this direction, and
this research should have a measurable impact on emotion research in
psychology. I show that a good way to do so is to investigate the psychological
core of what an emotion is: an experience. I present ideas on how the
experience of emotion could be modeled and provide evidence that several
computational models of emotion are already addressing the issue.",2009,http://arxiv.org/abs/0903.0735v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/0903.0735v1
emotion recognition,"Controlling for Confounders in Multimodal Emotion Classification via
  Adversarial Learning","['Mimansa Jaiswal', 'Zakaria Aldeneh', 'Emily Mower Provost']","Various psychological factors affect how individuals express emotions. Yet,
when we collect data intended for use in building emotion recognition systems,
we often try to do so by creating paradigms that are designed just with a focus
on eliciting emotional behavior. Algorithms trained with these types of data
are unlikely to function outside of controlled environments because our
emotions naturally change as a function of these other factors. In this work,
we study how the multimodal expressions of emotion change when an individual is
under varying levels of stress. We hypothesize that stress produces modulations
that can hide the true underlying emotions of individuals and that we can make
emotion recognition algorithms more generalizable by controlling for variations
in stress. To this end, we use adversarial networks to decorrelate stress
modulations from emotion representations. We study how stress alters acoustic
and lexical emotional predictions, paying special attention to how modulations
due to stress affect the transferability of learned emotion recognition models
across domains. Our results show that stress is indeed encoded in trained
emotion classifiers and that this encoding varies across levels of emotions and
across the lexical and acoustic modalities. Our results also show that emotion
recognition models that control for stress during training have better
generalizability when applied to new domains, compared to models that do not
control for stress during training. We conclude that is is necessary to
consider the effect of extraneous psychological factors when building and
testing emotion recognition models.",2019,http://arxiv.org/abs/1908.08979v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1908.08979v1

media is becoming a great instrument for expressing emotions in written form.
Paying attention to the context and the entire sentence help us to detect
emotion from texts. However, this perspective inhibits us from noticing some
emotional words or phrases in the text, particularly when the words express an
emotion implicitly rather than explicitly. On the other hand, focusing only on
the words and ignoring the context results in a distorted understanding of the
sentence meaning and feeling. In this paper, we propose a framework that
analyses text at both the sentence and word levels. We name it CEFER (Context
and Emotion embedded Framework for Emotion Recognition). Our four approach
facets are to extracting data by considering the entire sentence and each
individual word simultaneously, as well as implicit and explicit emotions. The
knowledge gained from these data not only mitigates the impact of flaws in the
preceding approaches but also it strengthens the feature vector. We evaluate
several feature spaces using BERT family and design the CEFER based on them.
CEFER combines the emotional vector of each word, including explicit and
implicit emotions, with the feature vector of each word based on context. CEFER
performs better than the BERT family. The experimental results demonstrate that
identifying implicit emotions are more challenging than detecting explicit
emotions. CEFER, improves the accuracy of implicit emotion recognition.
According to the results, CEFER perform 5% better than the BERT family in

as features for behavior recognition. We treat this emotion-related information
as behavioral primitives and further train higher level layers towards behavior
quantification. Through our analysis, we find that emotion-related information

importance of emotional-context in the expression of behavior by constraining

that the sequence of emotions is critical in behavior expression. To achieve

  Learning","['Jingyuan Yang', 'Jie Li', 'Leida Li', 'Xiumei Wang', 'Xinbo Gao']","Visual Emotion Analysis (VEA) has attracted increasing attention recently
with the prevalence of sharing images on social networks. Since human emotions
are ambiguous and subjective, it is more reasonable to address VEA in a label
distribution learning (LDL) paradigm rather than a single-label classification
task. Different from other LDL tasks, there exist intrinsic relationships
between emotions and unique characteristics within them, as demonstrated in
psychological theories. Inspired by this, we propose a well-grounded
circular-structured representation to utilize the prior knowledge for visual
emotion distribution learning. To be specific, we first construct an Emotion
Circle to unify any emotional state within it. On the proposed Emotion Circle,
each emotion distribution is represented with an emotion vector, which is
defined with three attributes (i.e., emotion polarity, emotion type, emotion
intensity) as well as two properties (i.e., similarity, additivity). Besides,
we design a novel Progressive Circular (PC) loss to penalize the
dissimilarities between predicted emotion vector and labeled one in a
coarse-to-fine manner, which further boosts the learning process in an
emotion-specific way. Extensive experiments and comparisons are conducted on
public visual emotion distribution datasets, and the results demonstrate that
the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.",2021,http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.12450v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.12450v2
emotion recognition,Meta Transfer Learning for Emotion Recognition,"['Dung Nguyen', 'Sridha Sridharan', 'Duc Thanh Nguyen', 'Simon Denman', 'David Dean', 'Clinton Fookes']","Deep learning has been widely adopted in automatic emotion recognition and
has lead to significant progress in the field. However, due to insufficient
annotated emotion datasets, pre-trained models are limited in their
generalization capability and thus lead to poor performance on novel test sets.
To mitigate this challenge, transfer learning performing fine-tuning on
pre-trained models has been applied. However, the fine-tuned knowledge may
overwrite and/or discard important knowledge learned from pre-trained models.
In this paper, we address this issue by proposing a PathNet-based transfer
learning method that is able to transfer emotional knowledge learned from one
visual/audio emotion domain to another visual/audio emotion domain, and
transfer the emotional knowledge learned from multiple audio emotion domains
into one another to improve overall emotion recognition accuracy. To show the
robustness of our proposed system, various sets of experiments for facial
expression recognition and speech emotion recognition task on three emotion
datasets: SAVEE, EMODB, and eNTERFACE have been carried out. The experimental
results indicate that our proposed system is capable of improving the

  Recognition","['Xucun Yan', 'Zihuai Lin', 'Zhiyun Lin', 'Branka Vucetic']","Emotion recognition or detection is broadly utilized in patient-doctor
interactions for diseases such as schizophrenia and autism and the most typical
techniques are speech detection and facial recognition. However, features
extracted from these behavior-based emotion recognitions are not reliable since
humans can disguise their emotions. Recording voices or tracking facial
expressions for a long term is also not efficient. Therefore, our aim is to
find a reliable and efficient emotion recognition scheme, which can be used for
non-behavior-based emotion recognition in real-time. This can be solved by
implementing a single-channel electrocardiogram (ECG) based emotion recognition
scheme in a lightweight embedded system. However, existing schemes have
relatively low accuracy. Therefore, we propose a reliable and efficient emotion
recognition scheme - exploitative and explorative grey wolf optimizer based SVM
(X - GWO - SVM) for ECG-based emotion recognition. Two datasets, one raw
self-collected iRealcare dataset, and the widely-used benchmark WESAD dataset
are used in the X - GWO - SVM algorithm for emotion recognition. This work
demonstrates that the X - GWO - SVM algorithm can be used for emotion
recognition and the algorithm exhibits superior performance in reliability

  Emotion Recognition","['Didan Deng', 'Liang Wu', 'Bertram E. Shi']","When recognizing emotions, subtle nuances in displays of emotion generate
ambiguity or uncertainty in emotion perception. Emotion uncertainty has been
previously interpreted as inter-rater disagreement among multiple annotators.
In this paper, we consider a more common and challenging scenario: modeling

Bayesian perspective, we propose to use deep ensembles to capture uncertainty
for multiple emotion descriptors, i.e., action units, discrete expression
labels and continuous descriptors. We further apply iterative
self-distillation. Iterative distillation over multiple generations
significantly improves performance in both emotion recognition and uncertainty
estimation. Our method generates single student models that provide accurate

emotion recognition,A Multimodal Corpus for Emotion Recognition in Sarcasm,"['Anupama Ray', 'Shubham Mishra', 'Apoorva Nunna', 'Pushpak Bhattacharyya']","While sentiment and emotion analysis have been studied extensively, the
relationship between sarcasm and emotion has largely remained unexplored. A
sarcastic expression may have a variety of underlying emotions. For example, ""I
love being ignored"" belies sadness, while ""my mobile is fabulous with a battery
backup of only 15 minutes!"" expresses frustration. Detecting the emotion behind
a sarcastic expression is non-trivial yet an important task. We undertake the
task of detecting the emotion in a sarcastic statement, which to the best of
our knowledge, is hitherto unexplored. We start with the recently released
multimodal sarcasm detection dataset (MUStARD) pre-annotated with 9 emotions.
We identify and correct 343 incorrect emotion labels (out of 690). We double
the size of the dataset, label it with emotions along with valence and arousal
which are important indicators of emotional intensity. Finally, we label each
sarcastic utterance with one of the four sarcasm types-Propositional, Embedded,
Likeprefixed and Illocutionary, with the goal of advancing sarcasm detection
research. Exhaustive experimentation with multimodal (text, audio, and video)

  Dialogue Emotion Recognition","['Jiang Li', 'Xiaoping Wang', 'Yingjian Liu', 'Zhigang Zeng']","Multimodal emotion recognition in conversation (ERC) has garnered growing
attention from research communities in various fields. In this paper, we
propose a Cross-modal Fusion Network with Emotion-Shift Awareness (CFN-ESA) for
ERC. Extant approaches employ each modality equally without distinguishing the
amount of emotional information in these modalities, rendering it hard to
adequately extract complementary information from multimodal data. To cope with
this problem, in CFN-ESA, we treat textual modality as the primary source of
emotional information, while visual and acoustic modalities are taken as the
secondary sources. Besides, most multimodal ERC models ignore emotion-shift
information and overfocus on contextual information, leading to the failure of
emotion recognition under emotion-shift scenario. We elaborate an emotion-shift
module to address this challenge. CFN-ESA mainly consists of unimodal encoder
(RUME), cross-modal encoder (ACME), and emotion-shift module (LESM). RUME is
applied to extract conversation-level contextual emotional cues while pulling
together data distributions between modalities; ACME is utilized to perform
multimodal interaction centered on textual modality; LESM is used to model
emotion shift and capture emotion-shift information, thereby guiding the

relationship between emotion and spatial-temporal EEG features. Specifically,
spatial attention and temporal attention are to learn the topological structure

within a one-second segment and temporal attention within one sample
sequentially to explore the influence degree of emotional stimulation on EEG
signals of diverse EEG electrodes in the same temporal segment. The
simultaneous spatial-temporal attention, whose spatial and temporal attention
are performed simultaneously, is used to model the relationship between
different spatial features in different time segments. The experimental results

describes a person within a scene with information relevant for emotion
perception. Towards this goal, we propose a set of natural language descriptors

emotional patterns and brain functional regions, demonstrating that dynamic
relationships between different brain regions are an essential factor affecting
emotion recognition determined through electroencephalography (EEG). Moreover,
in EEG emotion recognition, we can observe that clearer boundaries exist
between coarse-grained emotions than those between fine-grained emotions, based
on the same EEG data; this indicates the concurrence of large coarse- and small
fine-grained emotion variations. Thus, the progressive classification process
from coarse- to fine-grained categories may be helpful for EEG emotion

both the perception and production of emotions. The subjectivity of emotions
poses significant challenges in developing accurate and robust computational

with the collection of diverse datasets that account for psychological factors
in emotion production.
  To handle the challenge of non-representative training data, this work
collects the Multimodal Stressed Emotion dataset, which introduces controlled
stressors during data collection to better represent real-world influences on
emotion production. To address issues with label subjectivity, this research
comprehensively analyzes how data augmentation techniques and annotation

natural confounding variables and variations by employing adversarial networks
to isolate key factors like stress from learned emotion representations during
model training. For tackling concerns about leakage of sensitive demographic
variables, this work leverages adversarial learning to strip sensitive
demographic information from multimodal encodings. Additionally, it proposes
optimized sociological evaluation metrics aligned with cost-effective,
real-world needs for model testing.
  This research advances robust, practical emotion recognition through

relevant information from the whole signal. In this work, we propose to use a
Transformer-based model to process electrocardiograms (ECG) for emotion
recognition. Attention mechanisms of the Transformer can be used to build
contextualized representations for a signal, giving more importance to relevant
parts. These representations may then be processed with a fully-connected
network to predict emotions. To overcome the relatively small size of datasets
with emotional labels, we employ self-supervised learning. We gathered several
ECG datasets with no labels of emotion to pre-train our model, which we then
fine-tuned for emotion recognition on the AMIGOS dataset. We show that our
approach reaches state-of-the-art performances for emotion recognition using
ECG signals on AMIGOS. More generally, our experiments show that transformers

  Emotions in German and English Poetry","['Thomas Haider', 'Steffen Eger', 'Evgeny Kim', 'Roman Klinger', 'Winfried Menninghaus']","Most approaches to emotion analysis of social media, literature, news, and
other domains focus exclusively on basic emotion categories as defined by Ekman
or Plutchik. However, art (such as literature) enables engagement in a broader
range of more complex and subtle emotions. These have been shown to also
include mixed emotional responses. We consider emotions in poetry as they are
elicited in the reader, rather than what is expressed in the text or intended
by the author. Thus, we conceptualize a set of aesthetic emotions that are
predictive of aesthetic appreciation in the reader, and allow the annotation of
multiple labels per line to capture mixed emotions within their context. We
evaluate this novel setting in an annotation experiment both with carefully
trained experts and via crowdsourcing. Our annotation with experts leads to an
acceptable agreement of kappa = .70, resulting in a consistent dataset for
future large scale analysis. Finally, we conduct first emotion classification

emotion recognition,"A Multi-Componential Approach to Emotion Recognition and the Effect of
  Personality","['Gelareh Mohammadi', 'Patrik Vuilleumier']","Emotions are an inseparable part of human nature affecting our behavior in
response to the outside world. Although most empirical studies have been
dominated by two theoretical models including discrete categories of emotion
and dichotomous dimensions, results from neuroscience approaches suggest a
multi-processes mechanism underpinning emotional experience with a large
overlap across different emotions. While these findings are consistent with the
influential theories of emotion in psychology that emphasize a role for
multiple component processes to generate emotion episodes, few studies have
systematically investigated the relationship between discrete emotions and a
full componential view. This paper applies a componential framework with a
data-driven approach to characterize emotional experiences evoked during movie
watching. The results suggest that differences between various emotions can be
captured by a few (at least 6) latent dimensions, each defined by features
associated with component processes, including appraisal, expression,
physiology, motivation, and feeling. In addition, the link between discrete
emotions and component model is explored and results show that a componential
model with a limited number of descriptors is still able to predict the level
of experienced discrete emotion(s) to a satisfactory level. Finally, as
appraisals may vary according to individual dispositions and biases, we also
study the relationship between personality traits and emotions in our
computational framework and show that the role of personality on discrete
emotion differences can be better justified using the component model.",2020,http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.11370v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.11370v1
emotion recognition,"Emotion Recognition under Consideration of the Emotion Component Process
  Model","['Felix Casel', 'Amelie Heindl', 'Roman Klinger']","Emotion classification in text is typically performed with neural network
models which learn to associate linguistic units with emotions. While this
often leads to good predictive performance, it does only help to a limited
degree to understand how emotions are communicated in various domains. The
emotion component process model (CPM) by Scherer (2005) is an interesting
approach to explain emotion communication. It states that emotions are a
coordinated process of various subcomponents, in reaction to an event, namely
the subjective feeling, the cognitive appraisal, the expression, a
physiological bodily reaction, and a motivational action tendency. We
hypothesize that these components are associated with linguistic realizations:
an emotion can be expressed by describing a physiological bodily reaction (""he
was trembling""), or the expression (""she smiled""), etc. We annotate existing
literature and Twitter emotion corpora with emotion component classes and find
that emotions on Twitter are predominantly expressed by event descriptions or
subjective reports of the feeling, while in literature, authors prefer to
describe what characters do, and leave the interpretation to the reader. We
further include the CPM in a multitask learning model and find that this
supports the emotion categorization. The annotated corpora are available at

that match the speech content and emotion. However, existing methods often
neglect emotional facial expressions or fail to disentangle them from speech
content. To address this issue, this paper proposes an end-to-end neural
network to disentangle different emotions in speech so as to generate rich 3D
facial expressions. Specifically, we introduce the emotion disentangling
encoder (EDE) to disentangle the emotion and content in the speech by
cross-reconstructed speech signals with different emotion labels. Then an
emotion-guided feature fusion decoder is employed to generate a 3D talking face
with enhanced emotion. The decoder is driven by the disentangled identity,
emotional, and content embeddings so as to generate controllable personal and
emotional styles. Finally, considering the scarcity of the 3D emotional talking
face data, we resort to the supervision of facial blendshapes, which enables
the reconstruction of plausible 3D faces from 2D emotional data, and contribute
a large-scale 3D emotional talking face dataset (3D-ETF) to train the network.
Our experiments and user studies demonstrate that our approach outperforms
state-of-the-art methods and exhibits more diverse facial movements. We

in fields like speech synthesis and natural language understanding. Most prior
studies, such as speech emotion recognition, have categorized speech emotions
into a fixed set of classes. Yet, emotions expressed in human speech are often
complex, and categorizing them into predefined groups can be insufficient to
adequately represent speech emotions. On the contrary, describing speech
emotions directly by means of natural language may be a more effective
approach. Regrettably, there are not many studies available that have focused
on this direction. Therefore, this paper proposes a speech emotion captioning
framework named SECap, aiming at effectively describing speech emotions using
natural language. Owing to the impressive capabilities of large language models
in language comprehension and text generation, SECap employs LLaMA as the text
decoder to allow the production of coherent speech emotion captions. In
addition, SECap leverages HuBERT as the audio encoder to extract general speech
features and Q-Former as the Bridge-Net to provide LLaMA with emotion-related
speech features. To accomplish this, Q-Former utilizes mutual information
learning to disentangle emotion-related speech features and speech contents,
while implementing contrastive learning to extract more emotion-related speech
features. The results of objective and subjective evaluations demonstrate that:
1) the SECap framework outperforms the HTSAT-BART baseline in all objective
evaluations; 2) SECap can generate high-quality speech emotion captions that
attain performance on par with human annotators in subjective mean opinion

application of discrepancy loss, enabling the model to effectively learn IER

'hate,' and 'anger.' Additionally, a novel interpretability method, Divide and
Conquer based Shap (DnCShap), is introduced to elucidate the visual features
most relevant for emotion recognition. The proposed IER system demonstrated
emotion classification accuracies of 61.86% for the IAPSa dataset, 62.47 for
the ArtPhoto dataset, 70.78% for the FI dataset, and 59.72% for the EMOTIC

web-based similarity (e.g. confidence, PMI and PMING). We aim to extract basic
emotions from short sentences with emotional content (e.g. news titles, tweets,
captions), performing a web-based quantitative evaluation of semantic proximity
between each word of the analyzed sentence and each emotion of a psychological
model (e.g. Plutchik, Ekman, Lovheim). The phases of the extraction include:
text preprocessing (tokenization, stop words, filtering), search engine
automated query, HTML parsing of results (i.e. scraping), estimation of
semantic proximity, ranking of emotions according to proximity measures. The
main idea is that, since it is possible to generalize semantic similarity under
the assumption that similar concepts co-occur in documents indexed in search
engines, therefore also emotions can be generalized in the same way, through
tags or terms that express them in a particular language, ranking emotions.
Training results are compared to human evaluation, then additional comparative
tests on results are performed, both for the global ranking correlation (e.g.
Kendall, Spearman, Pearson) both for the evaluation of the emotion linked to

  Hidden Markov Models","['Prasad Reddy P. V. G. D', 'A. Prasad', 'Y. Srinivas', 'P. Brahmaiah']","Automatic emotion recognition in speech is a research area with a wide range
of applications in human interactions. The basic mathematical tool used for
emotion recognition is Pattern recognition which involves three operations,
namely, pre-processing, feature extraction and classification. This paper
introduces a procedure for emotion recognition using Hidden Markov Models
(HMM), which is used to divide five emotional states: anger, surprise,
happiness, sadness and neutral state. The approach is based on standard speech
recognition technology using hidden continuous markov model by selection of low
level features and the design of the recognition system. Emotional Speech
Database from Telugu Rural Dialects of Andhra Pradesh (TRDAP) was designed
using several speaker's voices comprising the emotional states. The accuracy of
recognizing five different emotions for both genders of classification is 80%
for anger-emotion which is achieved by using the best combination of
39-dimensioanl feature vector for every frame (13 MFCCs, 13 Delta Coefficients

realistically, and directly from speech signals. While the best recent methods
generate 3D animations that are synchronized with the input audio, they largely
ignore the impact of emotions on facial expressions. Realistic facial animation
requires lip-sync together with the natural expression of emotion. To that end,
we propose EMOTE (Expressive Model Optimized for Talking with Emotion), which
generates 3D talking-head avatars that maintain lip-sync from speech while
enabling explicit control over the expression of emotion. To achieve this, we
supervise EMOTE with decoupled losses for speech (i.e., lip-sync) and emotion.
These losses are based on two key observations: (1) deformations of the face
due to speech are spatially localized around the mouth and have high temporal
frequency, whereas (2) facial expressions may deform the whole face and occur
over longer intervals. Thus, we train EMOTE with a per-frame lip-reading loss
to preserve the speech-dependent content, while supervising emotion at the
sequence level. Furthermore, we employ a content-emotion exchange mechanism in
order to supervise different emotions on the same audio, while maintaining the
lip motion synchronized with the speech. To employ deep perceptual losses
without getting undesirable artifacts, we devise a motion prior in the form of
a temporal VAE. Due to the absence of high-quality aligned emotional 3D face
datasets with speech, EMOTE is trained with 3D pseudo-ground-truth extracted
from an emotional video dataset (i.e., MEAD). Extensive qualitative and

a bottleneck for downstream tasks. To lay a foundation for studies on emotions

emotion-annotated corpus of task-oriented dialogues. EmoWOZ is based on
MultiWOZ, a multi-domain task-oriented dialogue dataset. It contains more than
11K dialogues with more than 83K emotion annotations of user utterances. In
addition to Wizard-of-Oz dialogues from MultiWOZ, we collect human-machine
dialogues within the same set of domains to sufficiently cover the space of
various emotions that can happen during the lifetime of a data-driven dialogue
system. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first large-scale open-source

  Spectral Features","['Zachary Dair', 'Ryan Donovan', ""Ruairi O'Reilly""]","This work explores the effect of gender and linguistic-based vocal variations
on the accuracy of emotive expression classification. Emotive expressions are
considered from the perspective of spectral features in speech (Mel-frequency
Cepstral Coefficient, Melspectrogram, Spectral Contrast). Emotions are
considered from the perspective of Basic Emotion Theory. A convolutional neural
network is utilised to classify emotive expressions in emotive audio datasets
in English, German, and Italian. Vocal variations for spectral features
assessed by (i) a comparative analysis identifying suitable spectral features,
(ii) the classification performance for mono, multi and cross-lingual emotive
data and (iii) an empirical evaluation of a machine learning model to assess
the effects of gender and linguistic variation on classification accuracy. The
results showed that spectral features provide a potential avenue for increasing
emotive expression classification. Additionally, the accuracy of emotive
expression classification was high within mono and cross-lingual emotive data,
but poor in multi-lingual data. Similarly, there were differences in
classification accuracy between gender populations. These results demonstrate
the importance of accounting for population differences to enable accurate

emotion attributes: brightness, colorfulness, scene type, object class, facial
expression, and human action, which can help understand visual emotions in a
precise and interpretable way. The relevance of these emotion attributes is
validated by analyzing the correlations between them and visual emotion, as

  Emotion Recognition","['Xun Wu', 'Wei-Long Zheng', 'Bao-Liang Lu']","Compared with the rich studies on the motor brain-computer interface (BCI),
the recently emerging affective BCI presents distinct challenges since the
brain functional connectivity networks involving emotion are not well
investigated. Previous studies on emotion recognition based on
electroencephalography (EEG) signals mainly rely on single-channel-based
feature extraction methods. In this paper, we propose a novel emotion-relevant
critical subnetwork selection algorithm and investigate three EEG functional
connectivity network features: strength, clustering coefficient, and
eigenvector centrality. The discrimination ability of the EEG connectivity
features in emotion recognition is evaluated on three public emotion EEG
datasets: SEED, SEED-V, and DEAP. The strength feature achieves the best
classification performance and outperforms the state-of-the-art differential
entropy feature based on single-channel analysis. The experimental results
reveal that distinct functional connectivity patterns are exhibited for the
five emotions of disgust, fear, sadness, happiness, and neutrality.
Furthermore, we construct a multimodal emotion recognition model by combining
the functional connectivity features from EEG and the features from eye
movements or physiological signals using deep canonical correlation analysis.
The classification accuracies of multimodal emotion recognition are 95.08/6.42%
on the SEED dataset, 84.51/5.11% on the SEED-V dataset, and 85.34/2.90% and
86.61/3.76% for arousal and valence on the DEAP dataset, respectively. The
results demonstrate the complementary representation properties of the EEG
connectivity features with eye movement data. In addition, we find that the
brain networks constructed with 18 channels achieve comparable performance with
that of the 62-channel network in multimodal emotion recognition and enable
easier setups for BCI systems in real scenarios.",2020,http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.01973v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.01973v1

  Factorized Bilinear Pooling for Audio-visual Emotion Recognition","['Hengshun Zhou', 'Jun Du', 'Yuanyuan Zhang', 'Qing Wang', 'Qing-Feng Liu', 'Chin-Hui Lee']","Multimodal emotion recognition is a challenging task in emotion computing as
it is quite difficult to extract discriminative features to identify the subtle
differences in human emotions with abstract concept and multiple expressions.
Moreover, how to fully utilize both audio and visual information is still an
open problem. In this paper, we propose a novel multimodal fusion attention
network for audio-visual emotion recognition based on adaptive and multi-level
factorized bilinear pooling (FBP). First, for the audio stream, a fully
convolutional network (FCN) equipped with 1-D attention mechanism and local
response normalization is designed for speech emotion recognition. Next, a
global FBP (G-FBP) approach is presented to perform audio-visual information
fusion by integrating selfattention based video stream with the proposed audio
stream. To improve G-FBP, an adaptive strategy (AG-FBP) to dynamically
calculate the fusion weight of two modalities is devised based on the
emotion-related representation vectors from the attention mechanism of
respective modalities. Finally, to fully utilize the local emotion information,
adaptive and multi-level FBP (AMFBP) is introduced by combining both
global-trunk and intratrunk data in one recording on top of AG-FBP. Tested on
the IEMOCAP corpus for speech emotion recognition with only audio stream, the
new FCN method outperforms the state-ofthe-art results with an accuracy of
71.40%. Moreover, validated on the AFEW database of EmotiW2019 sub-challenge

studied by many researchers. Previous methods have performed well for
intra-subject EEG emotion recognition. However, the style mismatch between
source domain (training data) and target domain (test data) EEG samples caused
by huge inter-domain differences is still a critical problem for EEG emotion
recognition. To solve the problem of cross-dataset EEG emotion recognition, in
this paper, we propose an EEG-based Emotion Style Transfer Network (E2STN) to
obtain EEG representations that contain the content information of source
domain and the style information of target domain, which is called stylized
emotional EEG representations. The representations are helpful for
cross-dataset discriminative prediction. Concretely, E2STN consists of three
modules, i.e., transfer module, transfer evaluation module, and discriminative
prediction module. The transfer module encodes the domain-specific information
of source and target domains and then re-constructs the source domain's
emotional pattern and the target domain's statistical characteristics into the
new stylized EEG representations. In this process, the transfer evaluation
module is adopted to constrain the generated representations that can more
precisely fuse two kinds of complementary information from source and target
domains and avoid distorting. Finally, the generated stylized EEG
representations are fed into the discriminative prediction module for final
classification. Extensive experiments show that the E2STN can achieve the

even more extreme sense of terror and brutality. The current study aimed to
examine how mass shooters suicidality and suicide behavioral threshold
influence the severity of the mass shooting. We employed Bayesian Mindsponge
Framework (BMF) analytics on a dataset of 194 mass shooters (incidents with
four or more victims killed) from 1966 to 2023 in the United States (U.S.). The
data were retrieved from The Violence Project Database, originally supported by
the National Institute of Justice, U.S. Department of Justice. Based on the
statistical analysis, we discovered that mass shooters with suicidal ideation
were more likely to kill two more victims on average than their non-suicidal
counterparts. For suicidal mass shooters found dead on the scene (either by
self-killing or suicide by cop), their victim count rises by around four on
average when compared to non-suicidal mass shooters. The findings were reasoned
through the information-processing perspective of the Mindsponge Theory. Based
on the findings and reasoning, we suggest that mass shootings should be
considered within larger socio-cultural settings instead of attributing it to
be driven primarily by diagnosable psychopathology. Also, promoting an
appropriate interpretation of the values of life and death can be an effective
way to alleviate the effects of suicidality on mass shooting severity.",2023,http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.14230v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.14230v1

  posts in social media platforms","['Shini Renjith', 'Annie Abraham', 'Surya B. Jyothi', 'Lekshmi Chandran', 'Jincy Thomson']","Suicidal ideation detection from social media is an evolving research with
great challenges. Many of the people who have the tendency to suicide share
their thoughts and opinions through social media platforms. As part of many
researches it is observed that the publicly available posts from social media
contain valuable criteria to effectively detect individuals with suicidal
thoughts. The most difficult part to prevent suicide is to detect and
understand the complex risk factors and warning signs that may lead to suicide.
This can be achieved by identifying the sudden changes in a user behavior
automatically. Natural language processing techniques can be used to collect
behavioral and textual features from social media interactions and these
features can be passed to a specially designed framework to detect anomalies in
human interactions that are indicators of suicidal intentions. We can achieve
fast detection of suicidal ideation using deep learning and/or machine learning
based classification approaches. For such a purpose, we can employ the
combination of LSTM and CNN models to detect such emotions from posts of the
users. In order to improve the accuracy, some approaches like using more data
for training, using attention model to improve the efficiency of existing
models etc. could be done. This paper proposes a LSTM-Attention-CNN combined
model to analyze social media submissions to detect any underlying suicidal
intentions. During evaluations, the proposed model demonstrated an accuracy of
90.3 percent and an F1-score of 92.6 percent, which is greater than the

suicidal ideation,"Deep Learning for Suicide and Depression Identification with
  Unsupervised Label Correction","['Ayaan Haque', 'Viraaj Reddi', 'Tyler Giallanza']","Early detection of suicidal ideation in depressed individuals can allow for
adequate medical attention and support, which in many cases is life-saving.
Recent NLP research focuses on classifying, from a given piece of text, if an
individual is suicidal or clinically healthy. However, there have been no major
attempts to differentiate between depression and suicidal ideation, which is an
important clinical challenge. Due to the scarce availability of EHR data,
suicide notes, or other similar verified sources, web query data has emerged as
a promising alternative. Online sources, such as Reddit, allow for anonymity
that prompts honest disclosure of symptoms, making it a plausible source even
in a clinical setting. However, these online datasets also result in lower
performance, which can be attributed to the inherent noise in web-scraped
labels, which necessitates a noise-removal process. Thus, we propose SDCNL, a
suicide versus depression classification method through a deep learning
approach. We utilize online content from Reddit to train our algorithm, and to
verify and correct noisy labels, we propose a novel unsupervised label
correction method which, unlike previous work, does not require prior noise
distribution information. Our extensive experimentation with multiple deep word

major difficulty is the lack of training samples given the small number of true

in clinical notes by addressing this data sparsity issue through zero-shot
learning. U.S. Veterans Affairs clinical notes served as data. The training
dataset label was determined using diagnostic codes of suicide attempt and
self-harm. A base string associated with the target label of suicidality was
used to provide auxiliary information by narrowing the positive training cases
to those containing the base string. A deep neural network was trained by
mapping the training documents contents to a semantic space. For comparison, we
trained another deep neural network using the identical training dataset labels
and bag-of-words features. The zero shot learning model outperformed the
baseline model in terms of AUC, sensitivity, specificity, and positive
predictive value at multiple probability thresholds. In applying a 0.90

  cognitive network science","['Andreia Sofia Teixeira', 'Szymon Talaga', 'Trevor James Swanson', 'Massimo Stella']","Understanding the cognitive and emotional perceptions of people who commit
suicide is one of the most sensitive scientific challenges. There are
circumstances where people feel the need to leave something written, an
artifact where they express themselves, registering their last words and
feelings. These suicide notes are of utmost importance for better understanding
the psychology of suicidal ideation. This work gives structure to the
linguistic content of suicide notes, revealing interconnections between
cognitive and emotional states of people who committed suicide. We build upon
cognitive network science, psycholinguistics and semantic frame theory to
introduce a network representation of the mindset expressed in suicide notes.
Our cognitive network representation enables the quantitative analysis of the
language in suicide notes through structural balance theory, semantic
prominence and emotional profiling. Our results indicate that the emotional
syntax connecting positively- and negatively-valenced terms gives rise to a
degree of structural balance that is significantly higher than null models
where the affective structure was randomized. We show that suicide notes are
affectively compartmentalized such that positive concepts tend to cluster
together and dominate the overall network structure. A key positive concept is
""love"", which integrates information relating the self to others in ways that
are semantically prominent across suicide notes. The emotions populating the
semantic frame of ""love"" combine joy and trust with anticipation and sadness,
which connects with psychological theories about meaning-making and narrative
psychology. Our results open new ways for understanding the structure of
genuine suicide notes informing future research for suicide prevention.",2020,http://arxiv.org/abs/2007.12053v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.12053v3

We apply machine learning methods to classify large quantities of Twitter data

with a linear SVM) and two state-of-the-art deep learning models (BERT, XLNet).
The two deep learning models achieved the best performance in two
classification tasks: In the first task, we classified six main content
categories, including personal stories about either suicidal ideation and
attempts or coping, calls for action intending to spread either problem
awareness or prevention-related information, reporting of suicide cases, and
other tweets irrelevant to these categories. The deep learning models reached
accuracy scores above 73% on average across the six categories, and F1-scores
in between 0.70 and 0.85 for all but the suicidal ideation and attempts
category (0.51-0.55). In the second task, separating tweets referring to actual
suicide from off-topic tweets, they correctly labeled around 88% of tweets,
with BERT achieving F1-scores of 0.93 and 0.74 for the two categories,

temporality of risk. The insights made possible by access to such data have
enormous clinical potential - most dramatically envisioned as a trigger to
employ timely and targeted interventions (i.e., voluntary and involuntary
psychiatric hospitalization) to save lives. In this work, we address this
knowledge gap by developing deep learning algorithms to assess suicide risk in
terms of severity and temporality from Reddit data based on the Columbia
Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS). In particular, we employ two deep
learning approaches: time-variant and time-invariant modeling, for user-level
suicide risk assessment, and evaluate their performance against a

reduced by increasing the sampling rate; however, this leads to increased
computational costs. The approximate score equations are equivalent to logistic

Which use cases are precluded reflects the values embedded in GM content
filtering. Recent work on red teaming proposes methods to bypass GM content
filters to generate harmful content. We coin the term green teaming to describe
methods of bypassing GM content filters to design for beneficial use cases. We
showcase green teaming by: 1) Using ChatGPT as a virtual patient to simulate a
person experiencing suicidal ideation, for suicide support training; 2) Using
Codex to intentionally generate buggy solutions to train students on debugging;
and 3) Examining an Instagram page using Midjourney to generate images of
anti-LGBTQ+ politicians in drag. Finally, we discuss how our use cases
demonstrate green teaming as both a practical design method and a mode of
critique, which problematizes and subverts current understandings of harms and

social care and knowledge sharing within intelligent agents, this paper
develops a knowledge transferring framework via model aggregation. Under this
framework, distributed clients perform on-device training, and a third-party
server integrates multiple clients' models and redistributes to clients for
knowledge transferring among users. To improve the generalizability of the
knowledge sharing, we further propose a novel model aggregation algorithm,
namely the average difference descent aggregation (AvgDiffAgg for short). In

these models: 1) are robust to certain gender-sensitive variations in text; 2)
rely on the important depressive language marker of the increased use of first
person pronouns; 3) fail to detect some other depression symptoms like suicidal

with rural areas typically witnessing higher suicide rates in the U.S. However,
previous studies often ignored the effect of socio-environmental factors on the
suicide rates and its regional disparity. To address these gaps, we propose a
holistic data-driven framework to model the associations of social
(demographic, socioeconomic) and environmental (climate) factors on suicide
rates, and study the disparities across urban and suburban areas. Leveraging
the county-level suicide data from 2000--2017 along with the
socio-environmental features, we trained, tested and validated a suite of
advanced statistical learning algorithms to identify, assess and predict the
influence of key socio-environmental factors on suicide rates. Random forest
outperformed all other models in terms of goodness-of-fit and predictive
accuracy, and selected as the final model to make inferences. Our results
indicate that population demographics is significantly associated with both
urban and suburban suicide rates. We found that suburban population is more
vulnerable to suicides compared to urban communities, with suburban suicide
rate being particularly sensitive to unemployment rate and median household
income. Our analysis revealed that suicide mortality is correlated to climate,
showing that urban suicide rate is more sensitive to higher temperatures,
seasonal-heating-degree-days and precipitation, while suburban suicide rate is
sensitive to only seasonal-cooling-degree-days. This work provides deeper
insights on interactions between key socio-environmental factors and suicides

platforms could provide crucial insight into caregivers' needs during this
vulnerable time. In the current work, we provide a descriptive analysis of the
concerns, psychological states, and motivations shared by healthy and
distressed postpartum support seekers on two digital platforms, a one-on-one
digital helpline and a publicly available online forum. Using a combination of
human annotations, dictionary models and unsupervised techniques, we find stark
differences between the experiences of distressed and healthy mothers.
Distressed mothers described interpersonal problems and a lack of support, with
8.60% - 14.56% reporting severe symptoms including suicidal ideation. In

propensity score matching and analyzed causal associations between toxicity and
users' emotions. In general, we found that users receiving toxic replies are
more likely to express emotions of anger, sadness, and anxiety compared to
users who did not receive toxic replies. Finally, analysis results indicate
that the conversation topic and users' account characteristics are likely to
affect their emotional responses to toxicity. Our findings provide a better

Suicide."" An immediate and unconventional challenge is that the identification

almost 20% of ""suspected"" suicide attempts are identified from diagnosis codes

develop an integrative Cox cure model with regularization to perform survival
regression with uncertain events and a latent cure fraction. We apply the
proposed approach to study the risk of subsequent suicide attempts after
suicide-related hospitalization for the adolescent and young adult population,
using medical claims data from Connecticut. The identified risk factors are
highly interpretable; more intriguingly, our method distinguishes the risk
factors that are most helpful in assessing either susceptibility or timing of

seem to be associated with suicide mortality. However, results are
inconclusive, which might be because dynamics in the social context are not
well-represented by administratively bounded neighbourhoods at baseline. We
used individualized neighbourhoods to examine associations between suicide
mortality, social fragmentation, and deprivation for the total population as
well as by sex and age group. Methods: Using a nested case-control design, all
suicides aged 18-64 years between 2007 and 2016 were selected from longitudinal
Dutch register data and matched with 10 random controls. Indices for social
fragmentation and deprivation were calculated annually for 300, 600, and 1,000
metre circular buffers around each subject's residential address. Results:
Suicide mortality was significantly higher in neighbourhoods with high
deprivation and social fragmentation. Accounting for individual characteristics
largely attenuated these associations. Suicide mortality remained significantly
higher for women living in highly fragmented neighbourhoods in the fully
adjusted model. Age-stratified analyses indicate associations with
neighbourhood fragmentation among women in older age groups (40-64 years) only.
Among men, suicide risk was lower in fragmented neighbourhoods for
18-39-year-olds and for short-term residents. In deprived neighbourhoods, the
suicide risk was lower for 40-64-year-old men and long-term residents.
Associations between neighbourhood characteristics and suicide mortality were
comparable across buffer sizes. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that next to

  Collective Creativity in Crowd Ideation","['Samuel Rhys Cox', 'Yunlong Wang', 'Ashraf Abdul', 'Christian von der Weth', 'Brian Y. Lim']","Crowdsourcing can collect many diverse ideas by prompting ideators
individually, but this can generate redundant ideas. Prior methods reduce
redundancy by presenting peers' ideas or peer-proposed prompts, but these
require much human coordination. We introduce Directed Diversity, an automatic
prompt selection approach that leverages language model embedding distances to
maximize diversity. Ideators can be directed towards diverse prompts and away
from prior ideas, thus improving their collective creativity. Since there are
diverse metrics of diversity, we present a Diversity Prompting Evaluation
Framework consolidating metrics from several research disciplines to analyze
along the ideation chain - prompt selection, prompt creativity, prompt-ideation
mediation, and ideation creativity. Using this framework, we evaluated Directed
Diversity in a series of a simulation study and four user studies for the use

show that automated diverse prompting can variously improve collective

suicidal ideation,"Combining Broad and Narrow Case Definitions in Matched Case-Control
  Studies: Firearms in the Home and Suicide Risk","['Ting Ye', 'Kan Chen', 'Dylan S. Small']","Does having firearms in the home increase suicide risk? To test this
hypothesis, a matched case-control study can be performed, in which suicide
case subjects are compared to living controls who are similar in observed
covariates in terms of their retrospective exposure to firearms at home. In
this application, cases can be defined using a broad case definition (suicide)
or a narrow case definition (suicide occurred at home). The broad case
definition offers a larger number of cases but the narrow case definition may
offer a larger effect size. Moreover, restricting to the narrow case definition
may introduce selection bias (i.e., bias due to selecting samples based on
characteristics affected by the treatment) because exposure to firearms in the
home may affect the location of suicide and thus the type of a case a subject
is. We propose a new sensitivity analysis framework for combining broad and
narrow case definitions in matched case-control studies, that considers the
unmeasured confounding bias and selection bias simultaneously. We develop a
valid randomization-based testing procedure using only the narrow case matched
sets when the effect of the unmeasured confounder on receiving treatment and
the effect of the treatment on case definition among the always-cases are
controlled by sensitivity parameters. We then use the Bonferroni method to
combine the testing procedures using the broad and narrow case definitions.
With the proposed methods, we find robust evidence that having firearms at home
increases suicide risk.",2021,http://arxiv.org/abs/2105.01124v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.01124v3

  Symptom-Aware Multitask Learning","['Daeun Lee', 'Sejung Son', 'Hyolim Jeon', 'Seungbae Kim', 'Jinyoung Han']","Bipolar disorder (BD) is closely associated with an increased risk of
suicide. However, while the prior work has revealed valuable insight into
understanding the behavior of BD patients on social media, little attention has
been paid to developing a model that can predict the future suicidality of a BD
patient. Therefore, this study proposes a multi-task learning model for
predicting the future suicidality of BD patients by jointly learning current
symptoms. We build a novel BD dataset clinically validated by psychiatrists,
including 14 years of posts on bipolar-related subreddits written by 818 BD
patients, along with the annotations of future suicidality and BD symptoms. We
also suggest a temporal symptom-aware attention mechanism to determine which
symptoms are the most influential for predicting future suicidality over time
through a sequence of BD posts. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed
model outperforms the state-of-the-art models in both BD symptom identification
and future suicidality prediction tasks. In addition, the proposed temporal
symptom-aware attention provides interpretable attention weights, helping
clinicians to apprehend BD patients more comprehensively and to provide timely
intervention by tracking mental state progression.",2023,http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.00995v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.00995v1

  Anatomy broadcasting","['Luca Perri', 'Om S. Salafia']","Seasonality is one of the oldest and most elucidation-resistant issues in
suicide epidemiological research. Despite winter depression (also known as
Seasonal Affective Disorder, SAD) is known and treated since many years,
worldwide cross-sectional data from 28 countries show a lower frequency of
suicide attempts around the equinoxes and a higher frequency in spring (both in
Northern and Southern Hemisphere). This peak is not compatible with the SAD
explanation. However, in recent years epidemiological research has yielded new
results, which provide new perspectives on the matter. In fact, the discovery
of a new pathology called Post-Series Depression (PSD) could provide an
explanation of the suicide attempts pattern. The aim of this study is to
analyse weekly data in order to compare them with the TV series broadcasting.
Since medical observations in our sample are distributed over many years, in
order to compare them as best as we can with the television programming, Grey's
Anatomy series was chosen. This medical drama has been in the top 10 of most
viewed TV series since 12 years and it is broadcast all over the world, so that
it can be considered a universal and homogeneous phenomenon. A full season of
the series is split into two separate units with a hiatus around the end of the
calendar year, and it runs from September through May. Data analysis was made
in order to prove the correlation between PSD and the increase of suicide
attempts. Surprisingly, the data analysis shows that the increase of rate of
suicide attempts does not coincide with the breaks in Grey's Anatomy

increased risk of adolescent suicide attempts, while controlling for
socioeconomic and demographic differences. Design: A data-driven analysis using
cross-sectional data. Setting: Communities in the state of Montana from 1999 to
2017. Subjects: Selected 22,447 adolescents of whom 1,631 adolescents attempted
suicide at least once. Measures: Overall 29 variables (predictors) accounting
for psychological behaviors, illegal substances consumption, daily activities
at schools and demographic backgrounds, were considered. Analysis: A library of
machine learning algorithms along with the traditionally-used logistic
regression were used to model and predict suicide attempt risk. Model
performances (goodness-of-fit and predictive accuracy) were measured using
accuracy, precision, recall and F-score metrics. Results: The non-parametric

addresses these gaps and combines theory-driven and bottom-up strategies to
construct a hybrid and interpretable prediction model of valid suicide risk
from images. The lead hypothesis was that images contain valuable information
about emotions and interpersonal relationships, two central concepts in
suicide-related treatments and theories. The dataset included 177,220 images by
841 Facebook users who completed a gold-standard suicide scale. The images were
represented with CLIP, a state-of-the-art algorithm, which was utilized,
unconventionally, to extract predefined features that served as inputs to a
simple logistic-regression prediction model (in contrast to complex neural
networks). The features addressed basic and theory-driven visual elements using
everyday language (e.g., bright photo, photo of sad people). The results of the
hybrid model (that integrated theory-driven and bottom-up methods) indicated
high prediction performance that surpassed common bottom-up algorithms, thus
providing a first proof that images (alone) can be leveraged to predict
validated suicide risk. Corresponding with the lead hypothesis, at-risk users
had images with increased negative emotions and decreased belonginess. The
results are discussed in the context of non-verbal warning signs of suicide.
Notably, the study illustrates the advantages of hybrid models in such

suicidal ideation,Statistical Signs of Social Influence on Suicides,"['Hygor Piaget M. Melo', 'André A. Moreira', 'Hernán A. Makse', 'José S. Andrade Jr']","Certain currents in sociology consider society as being composed of
autonomous individuals with independent psychologies. Others, however, deem our
actions as strongly influenced by the accepted standards of social behavior.
The later view was central to the positivist conception of society when in 1887
\'Emile Durkheim published his monograph Suicide (Durkheim, 1897). By treating
the suicide as a social fact, Durkheim envisaged that suicide rates should be
determined by the connections (or the lack of them) between people and society.
Under the same framework, Durkheim considered that crime is bound up with the
fundamental conditions of all social life and serves a social function. In this
sense, and regardless of its extremely deviant nature, crime events are somehow
capable to release certain social tensions and so have a purging effect in
society. The social effect on the occurrence of homicides has been previously
substantiated (Bettencourt et al., 2007; Alves et al., 2013), and confirmed
here, in terms of a superlinear scaling relation: by doubling the population of
a Brazilian city results in an average increment of 135 % in the number of
homicides, rather than the expected isometric increase of 100 %, as found, for
example, for the mortality due to car crashes. Here we present statistical
signs of the social influence on the suicide occurrence in cities. Differently
from homicides (superlinear) and fatal events in car crashes (isometric), we
find sublinear scaling behavior between the number of suicides and city
population, with allometric power-law exponents, $\beta = 0.836 \pm 0.009$ and
$0.870 \pm 0.002$, for all cities in Brazil and US, respectively. The fact that
the frequency of suicides is disproportionately small for larger cities reveals
a surprisingly beneficial aspect of living and interacting in larger and more
complex social networks.",2014,http://arxiv.org/abs/1402.2510v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1402.2510v1

suicidal ideation,Suicide: the key role of short range ties,['Bertrand M. Roehner'],"The paper explores the connection between short-range social ties (i.e. links
with close relatives) and the occurrence of suicide. The objective is to
discriminate between a model based on social ties and a model based on
psychological traumas. Our methodological strategy is to focus on instances
characterized by the severance of some social ties. We consider several
situations of this kind. (i) Prisoners in the first days after their
incarceration. (ii) Prisoners in solitary confinement. (iii) Prisoners who are
transferred from one prison to another. (iv) Prisoners in closed versus open
prisons. (v) Prisoners in the weeks following their release. (vi) Immigrants in
the years following their relocation. (vii) Unmarried versus married people.
  Furthermore, in order to test the impact of major shocks we consider the
responses in terms of suicides to the following shocks. (i) The attack of
September 11, 2001 in Manhattan. (ii) The Korean War. (iii) The two world wars.
(iv) The Great Depression in the United States. (v) The hyperinflation episode
of 1923 in Germany. Major global traumatic shocks such as 9/11 or wars have no
influence on suicide rates once changing environment conditions have been
controlled for.
  Overall, it turns out that the observations have a natural interpretation in
terms of short-range ties. In contrast, the trauma model seems unable to
adequately account for many observations.",2005,http://arxiv.org/abs/physics/0502047v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/physics/0502047v1
suicidal ideation,How can one explain changes in the monthly pattern of suicide?,['Bertrand M. Roehner'],"The monthly pattern of suicides has remained a puzzle ever since it was
discovered in the second half of the 19th century. In this paper we intend to
""explain"" not the pattern itself but rather its changes across countries and in
the course of time. First, we show that the fairly common idea according to
which this pattern is decaying in ""modern"" societies is not altogether true.
For instance, around 2000, in well urbanized countries like South Korea or
Spain this pattern was still as strong as it was in France (and other European
countries) in the late 19th century. The method that we use in order to make
some progress in our understanding is the time-honoured Cartesian approach of
breaking up the problem under consideration ""into as many parts as might be
necessary to solve it"". More specifically, we try two decompositions of monthly
suicides: (i) according to suicide methods (ii) according to age-groups.
  The first decomposition points out the key-role of hanging and drowning. The
second shows the crucial role of the $ 15-20 $ and $ 65+ $ age-groups. Then, we
present a number of cases in which age-group decomposition provides adequate
predictions. It turns out that the cases in which the predictions do not work
are newly urbanized countries. The discrepancies may be due to a memory effect
which induces a time-lag extending over one or two generations. Finally, in the
light of the new results presented in the present paper, we re-examine the
theory proposed by Emile Durkheim.",2014,http://arxiv.org/abs/1408.5242v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1408.5242v1

  Autonomous Vehicles","['Yuhang Yang', 'Kalle Kujanpaa', 'Amin Babadi', 'Joni Pajarinen', 'Alexander Ilin']","Developing reliable autonomous driving algorithms poses challenges in
testing, particularly when it comes to safety-critical traffic scenarios
involving pedestrians. An open question is how to simulate rare events, not
necessarily found in autonomous driving datasets or scripted simulations, but
which can occur in testing, and, in the end may lead to severe pedestrian
related accidents. This paper presents a method for designing a suicidal
pedestrian agent within the CARLA simulator, enabling the automatic generation
of traffic scenarios for testing safety of autonomous vehicles (AVs) in
dangerous situations with pedestrians. The pedestrian is modeled as a
reinforcement learning (RL) agent with two custom reward functions that allow
the agent to either arbitrarily or with high velocity to collide with the AV.
Instead of significantly constraining the initial locations and the pedestrian
behavior, we allow the pedestrian and autonomous car to be placed anywhere in
the environment and the pedestrian to roam freely to generate diverse
scenarios. To assess the performance of the suicidal pedestrian and the target
vehicle during testing, we propose three collision-oriented evaluation metrics.
Experimental results involving two state-of-the-art autonomous driving
algorithms trained end-to-end with imitation learning from sensor data
demonstrate the effectiveness of the suicidal pedestrian in identifying

  Efficacy of Suicidal Altruism","['Anya Elaine Johnson', 'Eli Strauss', 'Rodney Pickett', 'Christoph Adami', 'Ian Dworkin', 'Heather J. Goldsby']","Within the context of evolution, an altruistic act that benefits the
receiving individual at the expense of the acting individual is a puzzling
phenomenon. An extreme form of altruism can be found in colicinogenic E. coli.
These suicidal altruists explode, releasing colicins that kill unrelated
individuals, which are not colicin resistant. By committing suicide, the
altruist makes it more likely that its kin will have less competition. The
benefits of this strategy rely on the number of competitors and kin nearby. If
the organism explodes at an inopportune time, the suicidal act may not harm any
competitors. Communication could enable organisms to act altruistically when
environmental conditions suggest that that strategy would be most beneficial.
Quorum sensing is a form of communication in which bacteria produce a protein
and gauge the amount of that protein around them. Quorum sensing is one means
by which bacteria sense the biotic factors around them and determine when to
produce products, such as antibiotics, that influence competition. Suicidal
altruists could use quorum sensing to determine when exploding is most
beneficial, but it is challenging to study the selective forces at work in
microbes. To address these challenges, we use digital evolution (a form of
experimental evolution that uses self-replicating computer programs as
organisms) to investigate the effects of enabling altruistic organisms to
communicate via quorum sensing. We found that quorum-sensing altruists killed a
greater number of competitors per explosion, winning competitions against
non-communicative altruists. These findings indicate that quorum sensing could
increase the beneficial effect of altruism and the suite of conditions under
which it will evolve.",2014,http://arxiv.org/abs/1406.0416v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1406.0416v1

by reconstructing syntactic/semantic associations between conceptsin texts as
co-occurrences enriched with affective data. We transform 142 suicide notes and
77,000 Reddit posts from the r/anxiety, r/depression, r/schizophrenia, and
r/do-it-your-own (r/DIY) forums into 5 cognitive networks, each one expressing
meanings and emotions as reported by authors. These networks reconstruct the
semantic frames surrounding 'feel', enabling a quantification of prominent
associations and emotions focused around feelings. We find strong feelings of
sadness across all clinical Reddit boards, added to fear r/depression, and
replaced by joy/anticipation in r/DIY. Semantic communities and topic modelling
both highlight key narrative topics of 'regret', 'unhealthy lifestyle' and 'low

with trustful/positive language, focused on 'getting better'. This emotional
polarisation provides quantitative evidence that online clinical boards possess
a complex structure, where users mix both positive and negative outlooks. This
dichotomy is absent in the r/DIY reference board and in suicide notes, where
negative emotional associations about regret and pain persist but are
overwhelmed by positive jargon addressing loved ones. Our quantitative

progress in generating realistic images. However, in this paper, we take a step
""backward"" and address AIGC for the most rudimentary visual modality of human
sketches. Our objective is on the creative nature of sketches, and that
creative sketching should take the form of an interactive process. We further
enable text to drive the sketch ideation process, allowing creativity to be
freely defined, while simultaneously tackling the challenge of ""I can't
sketch"". We present a method to generate controlled sketches using a
text-conditioned diffusion model trained on pixel representations of images.
Our proposed approach, referred to as SketchDreamer, integrates a
differentiable rasteriser of Bezier curves that optimises an initial input to
distil abstract semantic knowledge from a pretrained diffusion model. We
utilise Score Distillation Sampling to learn a sketch that aligns with a given
caption, which importantly enable both text and sketch to interact with the
ideation process. Our objective is to empower non-professional users to create
sketches and, through a series of optimisation processes, transform a narrative
into a storyboard by expanding the text prompt while making minor adjustments
to the sketch input. Through this work, we hope to aspire the way we create
visual content, democratise the creative process, and inspire further research
in enhancing human creativity in AIGC. The code is available at

  Automatic Mental Health Classification",['Alexander Ruch'],"Graph and language embedding models are becoming commonplace in large scale
analyses given their ability to represent complex sparse data densely in
low-dimensional space. Integrating these models' complementary relational and
communicative data may be especially helpful if predicting rare events or
classifying members of hidden populations - tasks requiring huge and sparse
datasets for generalizable analyses. For example, due to social stigma and
comorbidities, mental health support groups often form in amorphous online
groups. Predicting suicidality among individuals in these settings using
standard network analyses is prohibitive due to resource limits (e.g., memory),
and adding auxiliary data like text to such models exacerbates complexity- and
sparsity-related issues. Here, I show how merging graph and language embedding
models (metapath2vec and doc2vec) avoids these limits and extracts unsupervised
clustering data without domain expertise or feature engineering. Graph and
language distances to a suicide support group have little correlation (\r{ho} <
0.23), implying the two models are not embedding redundant information. When
used separately to predict suicidality among individuals, graph and language
data generate relatively accurate results (69% and 76%, respectively); however,
when integrated, both data produce highly accurate predictions (90%, with 10%
false-positives and 12% false-negatives). Visualizing graph embeddings
annotated with predictions of potentially suicidal individuals shows the
integrated model could classify such individuals even if they are positioned
far from the support group. These results extend research on the importance of
simultaneously analyzing behavior and language in massive networks and efforts
to integrate embedding models for different kinds of data when predicting and
classifying, particularly when they involve rare events.",2020,http://arxiv.org/abs/2001.01126v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2001.01126v1

domain-specific feature interaction networks. We introduces two indices that
measure the model stability against data resampling. Feature networks are used
to generate two multivariate Gaussian priors with sparse precision matrices

further progress was long hampered by the limited statistical data available
from death certificates. Recently, it was shown by the present authors that
disability data from census records can be used as a reliable substitute for
mortality data. This opens a new route to investigations of family ties because
census information goes much beyond the limited data reported on death
certificates. It is shown that the disability rate of adults decreases when
they have more family links. More precisely, the reduction of the parents'
disability brought about by the presence of a child reveals that the strength
of ties between parents and child is highest in the first year after birth and
then weakens steadily as the child ages. It will also be seen that the strength
of the bond between husband and wife is highest when they are of same age and

looked at the implications of rounding continuous random variables, rounding
may be applied to functions of discrete random variables as well. For example,
to infer on suicide excess deaths after a national emergency, authorities may
provide a rounded average of deaths before and after the emergency started.
Suicide rates tend to be relatively low around the world and such rounding may
seriously affect inference on the change of suicide rate. In this paper, we
study the scenario when a rounded to nearest integer average is used as a proxy
for a non-negative discrete random variable. Specifically, our interest is in
drawing inference on a parameter from the pmf of Y , when we get U = n[Y /n] as
a proxy for Y . The probability generating function of U , E(U ), and Var(U )
capture the effect of the coarsening of the support of Y . Also, moments and
estimators of distribution parameters are explored for some special cases. We
show that under certain conditions, there is little impact from rounding.
However, we also find scenarios where rounding can significantly affect

propose are able to partially counter rounding error effects. While for some

associated with increased risk of obesity, cognitive impairment, and suicidal
behaviors. Abdominal obesity and a higher risk of violent suicide attempt (SA)
seem to be shared correlates with older age, BD, and male sex until middle age
when menopause-related female body changes occur. This study aimed at assessing
the role of abdominal obesity and cognition in the violent SA burden of

Cross-sectional clinical, cognitive, and metabolic assessments were performed.

non-violent and no SA, was associated with higher waist circumference,
abdominal obesity and poorer California Verbal Learning Test short-delay free

circumference and abdominal obesity were associated with violent SA history

  nova T Pyxidis","['C. Knigge', 'A. R. King', 'J. Patterson']","We show that the extremely high luminosity of the short-period recurrent nova
T Pyx in quiescence can be understood if this system is a wind-driven supersoft
x-ray source (SSS). In this scenario, a strong, radiation-induced wind is
excited from the secondary star and accelerates the binary evolution. The
accretion rate is therefore much higher than in an ordinary cataclysmic binary
at the same orbital period, as is the luminosity of the white dwarf primary. In
the steady state, the enhanced luminosity is just sufficient to maintain the
wind from the secondary. The accretion rate and luminosity predicted by the
wind-driven model for T Pyx are in good agreement with the observational
evidence. X-ray observations with Chandra or XMM may be able to confirm T Pyx's
status as a SSS.
  T Pyx's lifetime in the wind-driven state is on the order of a million years.
Its ultimate fate is not certain, but the system may very well end up
destroying itself, either via the complete evaporation of the secondary star,
or in a Type Ia supernova if the white dwarf reaches the Chandrasekhar limit.

  interaction strengths",['Bertrand M. Roehner'],"One distinctive and pervasive aspect of social systems is the fact that they
comprise several kinds of agents. Thus, in order to draw parallels with
physical systems one is lead to consider binary (or multi-component) compounds.
Recent views about the mixing of liquids in solutions gained from neutron and
X-ray scattering show these systems to have a number of similarities with
socio-economic systems. It appears that such phenomena as rearrangement of
bonds in a solution, gas condensation, selective evaporation of molecules can
be transposed in a natural way to socio-economic phenomena. These connections
provide a novel perspective for looking at social systems which we illustrate
through some examples. For instance, we interpret suicide as an escape
phenomenon and in order to test that interpretation we consider social systems
characterized by very low levels of social interaction. For those systems
suicide rates are found to be 10 to 100 times higher than in the general
population. Another interesting parallel concerns the phase transition which
occurs when locusts gather together to form swarms which may contain several
billion insects. What hinders the thorough investigation of such cases from the
standpoint of collective phenomena that we advocate is the lack or inadequacy
of statistical data for, up to now, they were collected for completely

suicidal ideation,How are mortality rates affected by population density?,"['Lei Wang', 'Yijuan Xu', 'Zengru Di', 'Bertrand M. Roehner']","Biologists have found that the death rate of cells in culture depends upon
their spatial density. Permanent ""Stay alive"" signals from their neighbours
seem to prevent them from dying. In a previous paper (Wang et al. 2013) we gave
evidence for a density effect for ants. In this paper we examine whether there
is a similar effect in human demography. We find that although there is no
observable relationship between population density and overall death rates,
there is a clear relationship between density and the death rates of young
age-groups. Basically their death rates decrease with increasing density.
However, this relationship breaks down around 300 inhabitants per square
kilometre. Above this threshold the death rates remains fairly constant. The
same density effect is observed in Canada, France, Japan and the United States.
We also observe a striking parallel between the density effect and the
so-called marital status effect in the sense that they both lead to higher
suicide rates and are both enhanced for younger age-groups. However, it should
be noted that the strength of the density effect is only a fraction of the
strength of the marital status effect. In spite of the fact that this parallel
does not give us an explanation by itself, it invites us to focus on
explanations that apply to both effects. In this light the ""Stay alive""
paradigm set forth by Prof. Martin Raff appears as a natural interpretation. It
can be seen as an extension of the ""social ties"" framework proposed at the end
of the 19th century by the sociologist Emile Durkheim in his study about

and their changes over time, gender and reported location on the complete
online archives (42 million records) of the major US newspaper (The New York
Times) and the three major Italian ones (Il Corriere della Sera, La Repubblica,
La Stampa). Since the Italian language distinguishes between the female and

reported single female deaths to be about one-third of those involving single
men. We show evidence of censorship in Italian newspapers both during World War

World Wars and in Italy during the Fascist period is a historically ascertained

crises an opportunity to have an anonymous text message conversation with a
trained Crisis Volunteer (CV). This project partners with Shout and its parent
organisation, Mental Health Innovations, to explore the applications of Machine
Learning in understanding Shout's conversations and improving its service. The
overarching aim of this project is to develop a proof-of-concept model to
demonstrate the potential of applying deep learning to crisis text messages.
  Specifically, this project aims to use deep learning to (1) predict an
individual's risk of suicide or self-harm, (2) assess conversation success and
CV skill using robust metrics, and (3) extrapolate demographic information from
a texter survey to conversations where the texter did not complete the survey.
To these ends, contributions to deep learning include a modified
Transformer-over-BERT model; a framework for multitask learning to improve
generalisation in the presence of sparse labels; and a mathematical model for
using imperfect machine learning models to estimate population parameters from
a biased training set.
  Key results include a deep learning model with likely better performance at
predicting suicide risk than trained CVs and the ability to predict whether a
texter is 21 or under with 88.4% accuracy. We produce three metrics for
conversation success and evaluate the validity and usefulness for each.
Finally, reversal of participation bias provides evidence that women, who make
up 80.3% of conversations with an associated texter survey, make up closer to
73.5%- 74.8% of all conversations; and that if, after every conversation, the
texter had shared whether they found their conversation helpful, affirmative

evaluating the effect of any intervention or treatment. However, its
feasibility is often hindered by ethical, economical, and legal considerations,
making observational data a valuable alternative for drawing causal
conclusions. Nevertheless, healthcare observational data presents a difficult
challenge due to its high dimensionality, requiring careful consideration to
ensure unbiased, reliable, and robust causal inferences. To overcome this
challenge, in this study, we propose a novel two-stage feature selection
technique called, Outcome Adaptive Elastic Net (OAENet), explicitly designed
for making robust causal inference decisions using matching techniques. OAENet
offers several key advantages over existing methods: superior performance on
correlated and high-dimensional data compared to the existing methods and the
ability to select specific sets of variables (including confounders and
variables associated only with the outcome). This ensures robustness and
facilitates an unbiased estimate of the causal effect. Numerical experiments on
simulated data demonstrate that OAENet significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art methods by either producing a higher-quality estimate or a
comparable estimate in significantly less time. To illustrate the applicability
of OAENet, we employ large-scale US healthcare data to estimate the effect of
Opioid Use Disorder (OUD) on suicidal behavior. When compared to competing
methods, OAENet closely aligns with existing literature on the relationship
between OUD and suicidal behavior. Performance on both simulated and real-world

encountered in analyzing electronic health records (EHR) data, especially in
the modeling of disease onset with prior medical diagnoses and procedures.
Dealing with the resulting highly sparse and large-scale binary feature matrix
is notoriously challenging as conventional methods may suffer from a lack of
power in testing and inconsistency in model fitting while machine learning
methods may suffer from the inability of producing interpretable results or
clinically-meaningful risk factors. To improve EHR-based modeling and utilize
the natural hierarchical structure of disease classification, we propose a
tree-guided feature selection and logic aggregation approach for large-scale
regression with rare binary features, in which dimension reduction is achieved
through not only a sparsity pursuit but also an aggregation promoter with the
logic operator of ``or''. We convert the combinatorial problem into a convex
linearly-constrained regularized estimation, which enables scalable computation
with theoretical guarantees. In a suicide risk study with EHR data, our
approach is able to select and aggregate prior mental health diagnoses as
guided by the diagnosis hierarchy of the International Classification of
Diseases. By balancing the rarity and specificity of the EHR diagnosis records,
our strategy improves both prediction and model interpretation. We identify

crucial for early detection, intervention, and support, improving mental health

process, data from individuals with the specific disorder under consideration
are categorized as the positive class, while data from all other participants
constitute the negative class. In practice, it is widely recognized that
certain mental disorders share similar symptoms, causing the collected
behavioral data to encompass a variety of attributes associated with multiple
disorders. Consequently, attributes linked to the targeted mental disorder
might also be present within the negative class. This data impurity may lead to
sub-optimal training of the classifier for a mental disorder of interest. In

states of users on Reddit, whereas prior work is typically based on
content-based representations (e.g., n-grams, language model embeddings, etc).
We show that content-based representation is affected by domain and topic bias

addition, I show that mental health treatment operates distinctly from drug
addiction interventions in a multiple-treatment framework. I provide evidence
that mental health treatment's longer-term effectiveness is strongest among
more financially-advantaged probationers, consistent with this setting, in

is paving a new way to deliver mental health care. In this paper, we conduct a
scoping review on the development and application of XR in the area of mental

articles related to the usage of VR, AR, and MR in a mental health context. We
identified a total of 85 studies from 27 countries across the globe. By
performing data analysis, we found that most of the studies focused on
developed countries such as the US (16.47%) and Germany (12.94%). None of the
studies were for African countries. The majority of the articles reported that
XR techniques led to a significant reduction in symptoms of anxiety or
depression. More studies were published in the year 2021, i.e., 31.76% (n =

argue that mining online social behavior provides an opportunity to actively

mental factors considered in standard diagnostic criteria (questionnaire)
cannot be observed from online social activity logs. Our approach, new and
innovative to the practice of SNMD detection, does not rely on self-revealing
of those mental factors via questionnaires. Instead, we propose a machine

  folk psychological causal inference from neuroimaging data","['Jona Carmon', 'Moritz Bammel', 'Peter Brugger', 'Bigna Lenggenhager']","Introduction. Increased efforts in neuroscience try to understand mental
disorders as brain disorders. In the present study we investigate how common a
neuroreductionist inclination is among highly educated people. In particular,
we shed light on implicit presuppositions of mental disorders little is known
about in the public, exemplified here by the case of Body Integrity Dysphoria
(BID) that is considered a mental disorder for the first time in ICD-11.
  Methods. Identically graphed, simulated data of mind-brain correlations were
shown in three contexts with presumably different presumptions about causality.
738 highly-educated laymen rated plausibility of causality attribution from
brain to mind and from mind to brain for correlations between brain structural
properties and mental phenomena. We contrasted participants' plausibility
ratings of causality in the contexts of commonly perceived brain-lesion induced
behavior (aphasia), behavior-induced training effects (piano playing), and a
newly described mental disorder (BID).
  Results. The findings reveal the expected context-dependent modulation of
causality attributions in the contexts of aphasia and piano playing.
Furthermore, we observed a significant tendency to more readily attribute
causal inference from brain to mind than vice versa with respect to BID.
  Conclusion. In some contexts, exemplified here by aphasia and piano playing,
unidirectional causality attributions may be justified. However, with respect
to BID, we critically discuss presumably unjustified neuroreductionist
inclinations under causal uncertainty. Finally, we emphasize the need for a
presupposition-free approach in psychiatry.",2020,http://arxiv.org/abs/2006.06109v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.06109v2

  Linguistic Biosocial Markers","['Daniela Teodorescu', 'Tiffany Cheng', 'Alona Fyshe', 'Saif M. Mohammad']","Research in psychopathology has shown that, at an aggregate level, the
patterns of emotional change over time -- emotion dynamics -- are indicators of
one's mental health. One's patterns of emotion change have traditionally been
determined through self-reports of emotions; however, there are known issues
with accuracy, bias, and ease of data collection. Recent approaches to
determining emotion dynamics from one's everyday utterances addresses many of
these concerns, but it is not yet known whether these measures of utterance
emotion dynamics (UED) correlate with mental health diagnoses. Here, for the
first time, we study the relationship between tweet emotion dynamics and mental
health disorders. We find that each of the UED metrics studied varied by the
user's self-disclosed diagnosis. For example: average valence was significantly
higher (i.e., more positive text) in the control group compared to users with
ADHD, MDD, and PTSD. Valence variability was significantly lower in the control
group compared to ADHD, depression, bipolar disorder, MDD, PTSD, and OCD but
not PPD. Rise and recovery rates of valence also exhibited significant
differences from the control. This work provides important early evidence for

share their experiences about their day to day struggles. Reddit is a
well-recognized social media platform that provides focused and structured
forums called subreddits, that users subscribe to and discuss their experiences
with others. Temporal assessment of the topical correlation between social
media postings about mental health/substance use and postings about Coronavirus

between subreddits r/opiates, r/OpiatesRecovery, r/addiction, and r/Coronavirus
from January 2020 - October 2020. Our results show a high topical correlation
between postings in r/depression and r/Coronavirus in September 2020. Further,
the topical correlation between postings on substance use disorders and
Coronavirus fluctuates, showing the highest correlation in August 2020. By
monitoring these trends from platforms such as Reddit, epidemiologists, and

  Optimize Individualized Treatments","['Yuan Chen', 'Donglin Zeng', 'Tianchen Xu', 'Yuanjia Wang']","For mental disorders, patients' underlying mental states are non-observed
latent constructs which have to be inferred from observed multi-domain
measurements such as diagnostic symptoms and patient functioning scores.
Additionally, substantial heterogeneity in the disease diagnosis between
patients needs to be addressed for optimizing individualized treatment policy
in order to achieve precision medicine. To address these challenges, we propose
an integrated learning framework that can simultaneously learn patients'
underlying mental states and recommend optimal treatments for each individual.
This learning framework is based on the measurement theory in psychiatry for
modeling multiple disease diagnostic measures as arising from the underlying
causes (true mental states). It allows incorporation of the multivariate pre-
and post-treatment outcomes as well as biological measures while preserving the
invariant structure for representing patients' latent mental states. A
multi-layer neural network is used to allow complex treatment effect
heterogeneity. Optimal treatment policy can be inferred for future patients by
comparing their potential mental states under different treatments given the
observed multi-domain pre-treatment measurements. Experiments on simulated data
and a real-world clinical trial data show that the learned treatment polices
compare favorably to alternative methods on heterogeneous treatment effects,
and have broad utilities which lead to better patient outcomes on multiple

framework defines methods for direct computational analysis of symptoms in
disorganisation and psychomotor dimensions, as well as measures for indirect

  with simultaneous fMRI for emotion regulation","['Amin Dehghani', 'Hamid Soltanian-Zadeh', 'Gholam-Ali Hossein-Zadeh']","Emotion regulation plays a key role in human behavior and overall well-being.
Neurofeedback is a non-invasive self-brain training technique used for emotion
regulation to enhance brain function and treatment of mental disorders through
behavioral changes. Previous neurofeedback research often focused on using
activity from a single brain region as measured by fMRI or power from one or
two EEG electrodes. In a new study, we employed connectivity-based EEG
neurofeedback through recalling positive autobiographical memories and
simultaneous fMRI to upregulate positive emotion. In our novel approach, the
feedback was determined by the coherence of EEG electrodes rather than the
power of one or two electrodes. We compared the efficiency of this
connectivity-based neurofeedback to traditional activity-based neurofeedback
through multiple experiments. The results showed that connectivity-based
neurofeedback effectively improved BOLD signal change and connectivity in key
emotion regulation regions such as the amygdala, thalamus, and insula, and
increased EEG frontal asymmetry, which is a biomarker for emotion regulation
and treatment of mental disorders such as PTSD, anxiety, and depression and
coherence among EEG channels. The psychometric evaluations conducted both
before and after the neurofeedback experiments revealed that participants
demonstrated improvements in enhancing positive emotions and reducing negative
emotions when utilizing connectivity-based neurofeedback, as compared to
traditional activity-based and sham neurofeedback approaches. These findings
suggest that connectivity-based neurofeedback may be a superior method for
regulating emotions and could be a useful alternative therapy for mental

  Methods: Utilizing a rigorous scoping review process with PRISMA-ScR
guidelines, this investigation delves into the latest ML algorithms,
preprocessing techniques, and data types used in the context of stress and
stress-related MDs.
  Results and Discussion: A total of 98 peer-reviewed publications were
examined. The findings highlight that Support Vector Machine (SVM), Neural
Network (NN), and Random Forest (RF) models consistently exhibit superior
accuracy and robustness among ML algorithms. Physiological parameters such as
heart rate measurements and skin response are prevalently used as stress

suffering from debilitating mental affliction. The recent proliferation of
mental health discussions on social media platforms presents research
opportunities to investigate mental health and potentially detect instances of

emotions of a given population during the COVID-19 pandemic in Argentina based
on language expressions used in social media. This approach permits
anticipating high prevalence periods in short- to medium-term time horizons.
Design. Mental health conditions and emotions are captured via markers, which
link social media contents with lexicons. First, we build descriptive timelines
for decision makers to monitor the evolution of markers, and their correlation
with crisis events. Second, we model the timelines as time series, and support
their forecasting, which in turn serve to identify high prevalence points for
the estimated markers. Findings. Results showed that different time series
forecasting strategies offer different capabilities. In the best scenario, the
emergence of high prevalence periods of emotions and mental health disorders
can be satisfactorily predicted with a neural network strategy, even when
limited data is available in early stages of a crisis (e.g., 7 days).
Originality. Although there have been efforts in the literature to predict
mental states of individuals, the analysis of mental health at the collective
level has received scarce attention. We take a step forward by proposing a
forecasting approach for analyzing the mental health of a given population (or
group of individuals) at a larger scale. Practical implications. We believe

  Composition","['Baby Jerald A.', 'T. R. Gopalakrishnan Nair', 'Ekambaram Rajasekaran']","Ever since the disorder of proteins is the main cause for many diseases. As
compared with other disorders, the major reason that causes disease is of
structural inability of many proteins. The potentially imminent availability of
recent datasets helps one to discover the protein disorders, however in
majority of cases, the stability of proteins depend on the carbon content.
Addressing this distinct feature, it is possible to hit upon the carbon
distribution along the sequence and can easily recognize the stable nature of
protein. There are certain reported mental disorders which fall in to this
category. Regardless, such kind of disorder prone protein FMR1p (Fragile X
mental retardation 1 protein) is identified as the main cause for the disease
Fragile X syndrome. This paper deals with the identification of defects in the
FMR1 protein sequence considering the carbon contents along the sequence. This
attempt is to evaluate the stability of proteins, accordingly the protein
disorders in order to improvise the certain Biological functions of proteins to
prevent disease. The transition of the disorder to order protein involves
careful considerations and can be achieved by detecting the unstable region
that lacks hydrophobicity. This work focuses the low carbon content in the FMR1

  Autism: A Theoretical Approach via Artificial Neural Networks","['Daniele Q. M. Madureira', 'Vera Lucia P. S. Caminha', 'Rogerio Salvini']","A developmental disorder that severely damages communicative and social
functions, the Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) also presents aspects related to
mental rigidity, repetitive behavior, and difficulty in abstract reasoning.
More, imbalances between excitatory and inhibitory brain states, in addition to
cortical connectivity disruptions, are at the source of the autistic behavior.
Our main goal consists in unveiling the way by which these local excitatory
imbalances and/or long brain connections disruptions are linked to the above
mentioned cognitive features. We developed a theoretical model based on
Self-Organizing Maps (SOM), where a three-level artificial neural network
qualitatively incorporates these kinds of alterations observed in brains of
patients with ASD. Computational simulations of our model indicate that high
excitatory states or long distance under-connectivity are at the origins of
cognitive alterations, as difficulty in categorization and mental rigidity.
More specifically, the enlargement of excitatory synaptic reach areas in a
cortical map development conducts to low categorization (over-selectivity) and
poor concepts formation. And, both the over-strengthening of local excitatory
synapses and the long distance under-connectivity, although through distinct
mechanisms, contribute to impaired categorization (under-selectivity) and
mental rigidity. Our results indicate how, together, both local and global
brain connectivity alterations give rise to spoiled cortical structures in
distinct ways and in distinct cortical areas. These alterations would disrupt
the codification of sensory stimuli, the representation of concepts and, thus,
the process of categorization - by this way imposing serious limits to the
mental flexibility and to the capacity of generalization in the autistic
reasoning.",2018,http://arxiv.org/abs/1811.07020v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1811.07020v1

introduction. It has been widely applied in various fields due to its ability

constrained by two main issues. Firstly, the ""over-smoothing"" problem restricts
the use of deeper network structures. Secondly, GNNs' applicability is greatly
limited when nodes and edges are not clearly defined and expressed, as is the
case with EEG data.In this study, we proposed an innovative approach that
harnesses the distinctive properties of the graph structure's Markov Chain to
optimize the sampling depth of deep graph convolution networks. We introduced a
tailored method for constructing graph structures specifically designed for
analyzing EEG data, alongside the development of a vertex-level GNN

  Strategies for Bipolar Disorder Diagnosis and Treatment",['Trisha Guttal'],"This literature review involves the use of AI communication facilitators to
detect mood disorders such as bipolar disorder, a psychiatric condition in
which patients experience drastic mood shifts. Due to the ill-defined nature of
the disorder, it is difficult for even a psychiatrist alone to be confident
with their diagnosis. Changes in mental and mood state are often highly
subjective and difficult to pinpoint through short-term surveys and psychiatric
consultations. For many patients, diagnosis and treatment based on
trial-and-error is unavoidable. A timely and thorough diagnosis and treatment
plan is associated with the need for an equal involvement of both the patient
and the psychiatrist throughout the process. This conclusion is reached through
a detailed assessment of current interventions for (i) the ill-defined nature
of the disorder, and (ii) the trial-and-error requirement for medication and
diagnosis. As a result, I propose the implementation of an AI communication
facilitator that can aid in the appropriate diagnosis and treatment of bipolar

model can be broken down into specific critical decision points with
considerations made for each party involved in the process, aligning with the

The current psychiatric diagnostic process is based purely on the behavioural

quantitative fashion, we need advanced and scalable machine learning
infrastructure that will allow us to identify reliable biomarkers of mental

designed and implemented a joint learning procedure using an autoencoder and a
single layer perceptron which results in improved quality of extracted features

mental disorder,Employing Multimodal Machine Learning for Stress Detection,"['Rahee Walambe', 'Pranav Nayak', 'Ashmit Bhardwaj', 'Ketan Kotecha']","In the current age, human lifestyle has become more knowledge oriented
leading to generation of sedentary employment. This has given rise to a number
of health and mental disorders. Mental wellness is one of the most neglected
but crucial aspects of today's world. Mental health issues can, both directly
and indirectly, affect other sections of human physiology and impede an
individual's day-to-day activities and performance. However, identifying the
stress and finding the stress trend for an individual leading to serious mental
ailments is challenging and involves multiple factors. Such identification can
be achieved accurately by fusing these multiple modalities (due to various
factors) arising from behavioral patterns. Certain techniques are identified in
the literature for this purpose; however, very few machine learning-based
methods are proposed for such multimodal fusion tasks. In this work, a
multimodal AI-based framework is proposed to monitor a person's working
behavior and stress levels. We propose a methodology for efficiently detecting
stress due to workload by concatenating heterogeneous raw sensor data streams
(e.g., face expressions, posture, heart rate, computer interaction). This data
can be securely stored and analyzed to understand and discover personalized
unique behavioral patterns leading to mental strain and fatigue. The
contribution of this work is twofold; proposing a multimodal AI-based strategy
for fusion to detect stress and its level and secondly identify a stress
pattern over a period of time. We were able to achieve 96.09% accuracy on the
test set in stress detection and classification. Further, we reduce the stress
scale prediction model loss to 0.036 using these modalities. This work can
prove important for the community at large, specifically those working
sedentary jobs to monitor and identify stress levels, especially in current
times of COVID-19.",2023,http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.09385v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.09385v1

  Neurocognitive Disorder","['Susmita Bhaduri', 'Anirban Bhaduri', 'Rajib Sarkar']","Emotions(like fear,anger,sadness,happiness etc.) are the fundamental features
of human behavior and governs his/her mental health. The subtlety of emotional
fluctuations can be examined through perturbation in conversations or speech.
Analysis of emotional state of a person from acoustical features of speech
signal leads to discovery of vital cues determining his or her mental health.
Hence, it's an important field of research in the area of Human Computer
Interaction(HCI). In a recent work we have shown that how the contrast in
Hurst-Exponent calculated from the non-stationary and nonlinear aspects of
""angry"" and ""sad"" speech(spoken in English language) recordings in the
Toronto-Emotional-Speech-Set(TESS) can be used for early detection and
diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease. In this work we have extended the work and
extracted Hurst-exponent for the speech-signals of similar emotions but spoken
in German language. It has been observed that the Hurst-exponent efficiently
segregates the contrasting emotions of ""anger"" and ""sadness"" in the speech
spoken in German language, in similar fashion it has been doing for English
speech. Hence it can be concluded that the Hurst-exponent can differentiate
among speech spoken out of different emotions in language-independent manner.
We propose algorithm for a language-independent application for early
non-invasive detection of various severe neurocognitive-disorders like

comparatively limited success in spite of the fact that stress and anxiety

development of a more robust analytic framework for the measurement of

transferring knowledge and compatibility with other devices easier to achieve.
In our pipeline, a task-specific pooling based on an attention mechanism, which
estimates the contribution of each modality on an instance level, computes the
final embeddings for observations. This additionally provides a thorough
diagnostic insight into the data characteristics and highlights the importance
of signals in the broader view of predicting episodes annotated per mental

as the disorders characteristic biomarkers. These rhythms are the targets for
neurostimulation techniques. Open-loop neurostimulation employs stimulation

fitting in a pre-stimulus setup phase. Moreover, the algorithm takes into

This receptor has been observed to demonstrate higher levels of signaling from
positron emission tomography scans measured by its distribution volume ratios
in mice. Despite this evidence, studies are unable to fully verify the
involvement of mGluR5 as more empirical data is needed. Computational modeling
methods were used as a means of validation for previous hypotheses involving
mGluR5. The inadequacies in relation to the causal factor of OCD were answered
by utilizing T1 resting-state magnetic resonance imaging (TRS-MRI) scans of
patients suffering from schizophrenia, major depressive disorder, and
obsessive-compulsive disorder. Because comorbid cases often occur within these
disorders, cross-comparative abilities become necessary to find distinctive
characteristics. Two-dimensional convolutional neural networks alongside
ResNet50 and MobileNet models were constructed and evaluated for efficiency.
Activation heatmaps of TRS-MRI scans were outputted, allowing for
transcriptomics analysis. Though, a lack of ability to predict OCD cases
prevented gene expression analysis. Across all models, there was an 88.75%

categories are increasingly suspected to mis-represent the causes underlying
mental disturbance. Yet, psychiatrists and investigators now have an
unprecedented opportunity to benefit from complex patterns in brain, behavior,

modern neural-network algorithms, cross-validation procedures). Combining these
analysis techniques with a wealth of data from consortia and repositories has
the potential to advance a biologically grounded re-definition of major
psychiatric disorders. Within the next 10-20 years, incoming patients could be
stratified into distinct biological subgroups that cut across classical

Major depressive disorder (MDD), is a common mental health disorder that

  CreditRisk$+$","['Pavel V. Shevchenko', 'Jonas Hirz', 'Uwe Schmock']","Recently we developed a new framework in Hirz et al (2015) to model
stochastic mortality using extended CreditRisk$^+$ methodology which is very
different from traditional time series methods used for mortality modelling
previously. In this framework, deaths are driven by common latent stochastic
risk factors which may be interpreted as death causes like neoplasms,
circulatory diseases or idiosyncratic components. These common factors
introduce dependence between policyholders in annuity portfolios or between
death events in population. This framework can be used to construct life tables
based on mortality rate forecast. Moreover this framework allows stress testing
and, therefore, offers insight into how certain health scenarios influence
annuity payments of an insurer. Such scenarios may include improvement in
health treatments or better medication. In this paper, using publicly available
data for Australia, we estimate the model using Markov chain Monte Carlo method
to identify leading death causes across all age groups including long term
forecast for 2031 and 2051. On top of general reduced mortality, the proportion
of deaths for certain certain causes has changed massively over the period 1987
to 2011. Our model forecasts suggest that if these trends persist, then the
future gives a whole new picture of mortality for people aged above 40 years.
Neoplasms will become the overall number-one death cause. Moreover, deaths due
to mental and behavioural disorders are very likely to surge whilst deaths due
to circulatory diseases will tend to decrease. This potential increase in
deaths due to mental and behavioural disorders for older ages will have a
massive impact on social systems as, typically, such patients need long-term

neglected by their surroundings. Therefore, they turn to social media like
Twitter for support. Detecting users with potential depression and anxiety
disorders through textual data is not easy because they do not explicitly
discuss their mental state. It takes a model that can identify potential users
who experience depression and anxiety on textual data to get treatment earlier.
Text classification techniques can achieve this. One approach that can be used
is LSTM as an RNN architecture development in dealing with vanishing gradient
problems. Standard LSTM does not capture enough information because it can only
read sentences from one direction. Meanwhile, Bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM) is a
two-way LSTM that can capture information without ignoring the context and
meaning of a sentence. The proposed BiLSTM model is higher than all traditional
machine learning models and standard LSTMs. Based on the test results, the
highest accuracy obtained by BiLSTM reached 94.12%. This study has succeeded in

phenomenon known as the ""opioid crisis"". The relationship between substance use
and mental health has been extensively studied, with one possible relationship
being: substance misuse causes poor mental health. However, the lack of
evidence on the relationship has resulted in opioids being largely inaccessible
through legal means. This study analyzes the substance use posts on social
media with opioids being sold through crypto market listings. We use the Drug
Abuse Ontology, state-of-the-art deep learning, and knowledge-aware BERT-based
models to generate sentiment and emotion for the social media posts to
understand users' perceptions on social media by investigating questions such
as: which synthetic opioids people are optimistic, neutral, or negative about?
or what kind of drugs induced fear and sorrow? or what kind of drugs people
love or are thankful about? or which drugs people think negatively about? or
which opioids cause little to no sentimental reaction. We discuss how we
crawled crypto market data and its use in extracting posts for fentanyl,
fentanyl analogs, and other novel synthetic opioids. We also perform topic
analysis associated with the generated sentiments and emotions to understand
which topics correlate with people's responses to various drugs. Additionally,
we analyze time-aware neural models built on these features while considering

attempt to influence the brain's large-scale, dynamic network state transitions
underlying cognition and behavior. Building on connectome-based graph analysis
and control theory, Network Control Theory is emerging as a powerful tool to
quantify network controllability - i.e., the influence of one brain region over
others regarding dynamic network state transitions. If and how network
controllability is related to mental health remains elusive.
  Methods: From Diffusion Tensor Imaging data, we inferred structural
connectivity and inferred calculated network controllability parameters to
investigate their association with genetic and familial risk in patients
diagnosed with major depressive disorder (MDD, n=692) and healthy controls
(n=820).
  Results: First, we establish that controllability measures differ between
healthy controls and MDD patients while not varying with current symptom
severity or remission status. Second, we show that controllability in MDD
patients is associated with polygenic scores for MDD and psychiatric
cross-disorder risk. Finally, we provide evidence that controllability varies
with familial risk of MDD and bipolar disorder as well as with body mass index.
  Conclusions: We show that network controllability is related to genetic,
individual, and familial risk in MDD patients. We discuss how these insights

dynamical systems. In this study we investigate the dynamic behaviour of

dynamic multidimensional system (stochastic cellular automaton) to a
one-dimensional system to analyse the dynamics. Using maximum likelihood
estimation, we can estimate the parameter of interest which, in combination
with a bifurcation diagram, reflects the expectancy that someone has to
transition to another mood state. After validating the proposed method with
simulated data, we apply this method to two empirical examples, where we show
its use in a clinical sample consisting of patients diagnosed with major
depressive disorder, and a general population sample. Results showed that the
majority of the clinical sample was categorized as having an expectancy for a
transition, while the majority of the general population sample did not have

together with Boolean operators. Backward reference searching was also
conducted. Included peer-reviewed studies reported using a method or
application of ML in an MH context and focused on the populations of interest.

methods developed in the rapidly growing field of machine learning are being
increasingly applied to various problems in neuroimaging, from cognitive state

methods are designed to examine complex relationships between high-dimensional
signals, such as brain images, and outcomes of interest, such as the category
of a stimulus, a type of a mental state of a subject, or a specific mental

approaches that dominated neuroimaging in the past and treated each individual

  We believe that machine learning has a prominent role in shaping how
questions in neuroscience are framed, and that the machine-learning mind set is
now entering modern psychology and behavioral studies. It is also equally
important that practical applications in these fields motivate a rapidly
evolving line or research in the machine learning community. In parallel, there
is an intense interest in learning more about brain function in the context of
rich naturalistic environments and scenes. Efforts to go beyond highly specific

access to advanced medical care. The ability to accurately and efficiently
predict mood from easily collectible data has several important implications
for the early detection, intervention, and treatment of mental health
disorders. One promising data source to help monitor human behavior is daily
smartphone usage. However, care must be taken to summarize behaviors without
identifying the user through personal (e.g., personally identifiable
information) or protected (e.g., race, gender) attributes. In this paper, we
study behavioral markers of daily mood using a recent dataset of mobile
behaviors from adolescent populations at high risk of suicidal behaviors. Using
computational models, we find that language and multimodal representations of
mobile typed text (spanning typed characters, words, keystroke timings, and app
usage) are predictive of daily mood. However, we find that models trained to
predict mood often also capture private user identities in their intermediate
representations. To tackle this problem, we evaluate approaches that obfuscate
user identity while remaining predictive. By combining multimodal
representations with privacy-preserving learning, we are able to push forward
the performance-privacy frontier.",2021,http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.13213v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.13213v1

  Classification","['Jin Ming', 'Suprateek Kundu']","Objective: Brain networks have gained increasing recognition as potential
biomarkers in mental health studies, but there are limited approaches that can
leverage complex brain networks for accurate classification. Our goal is to
develop a novel Bayesian Support Vector Machine (SVM) approach that
incorporates high-dimensional networks as covariates and is able to overcome
limitations of existing penalized methods. Methods: We develop a novel
Dirichlet process mixture of double exponential priors on the coefficients in
the Bayesian SVM model that is able to perform feature selection and
uncertainty quantification, by pooling information across edges to determine
differential sparsity levels in an unsupervised manner. We develop different
versions of the model that incorporates static and dynamic connectivity
features, as well as an integrative analysis that jointly includes features
from multiple scanning sessions. We perform classification of intelligence
levels using resting state fMRI data from the Human Connectome Project (HCP),
and a second Attention Deficiency Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) classification
task. Results: Our results clearly reveal the considerable greater
classification accuracy under the proposed approach over state-of-the-art
methods. The multi-session analysis results in the highest classification
accuracy in the HCP data analysis. Conclusion: We provide concrete evidence
that the novel Bayesian SVMs provides an unsupervised and automated approach
for network-based classification, that results in considerable improvements
over penalized methods and parametric Bayesian approaches. Significance: Our
work is one of the first to conclusively demonstrate the advantages of a
Bayesian SVM in network-based classification of mental health outcomes, and the

The detection of mental health disorders in the early stages and a precise
diagnosis are critical to avoid social, physiological, or psychological side
effects. This work analyzes physiological signals to observe if different
depressive states have a noticeable impact on the blood volume pulse (BVP) and
the heart rate variability (HRV) response. Although typically, HRV features are
calculated from biosignals obtained with contact-based sensors such as
wearables, we propose instead a novel scheme that directly extracts them from
facial videos, just based on visual information, removing the need for any
contact-based device. Our solution is based on a pipeline that is able to
extract complete remote photoplethysmography signals (rPPG) in a fully
unsupervised manner. We use these rPPG signals to calculate over 60
statistical, geometrical, and physiological features that are further used to
train several machine learning regressors to recognize different levels of
depression. Experiments on two benchmark datasets indicate that this approach
offers comparable results to other audiovisual modalities based on voice or
facial expression, potentially complementing them. In addition, the results

less for the low perceptual load mode. Also, we found that the effect of
perceptual load on programmers' efficiency differs between those with and

Assessing the valence of hallucinated voices (i.e., how negative or positive

collect mobile sensing data as contextual signals. We then experiment with how
predictive these linguistic and contextual cues from the audio diary and mobile

performance when compared with adaptive and parcellated windows.
  Method: An administrative healthcare dataset was used, comprising of 240,219
individuals in Calgary, Alberta, Canada who were diagnosed with addiction or
mental health (AMH) between April 1, 2013, and March 31, 2018. The cohort was

  Results: Among 237,602 individuals, 0.8% (1,800) experienced first
homelessness, while 0.32% (759) reported initial police interaction among

Thus, in this research, we developed a gold standard data set that detects the
levels of depression as `not depressed', `moderately depressed' and `severely
depressed' from the social media postings. Traditional learning algorithms were
employed on this data set and an empirical analysis was presented in this
paper. Data augmentation technique was applied to overcome the data imbalance.
Among the several variations that are implemented, the model with Word2Vec

  Classifying Common Mental Illnesses on Social Media Posts","['Pratinav Seth', 'Mihir Agarwal']","Given the current state of the world, because of existing situations around
the world, millions of people suffering from mental illnesses feel isolated and
unable to receive help in person. Psychological studies have shown that our
state of mind can manifest itself in the linguistic features we use to
communicate. People have increasingly turned to online platforms to express
themselves and seek help with their conditions. Deep learning methods have been
commonly used to identify and analyze mental health conditions from various
sources of information, including social media. Still, they face challenges,
including a lack of reliability and overconfidence in predictions resulting in
the poor calibration of the models. To solve these issues, We propose UATTA-EB:

  Platforms","['Ashish Sharma', 'Monojit Choudhury', 'Tim Althoff', 'Amit Sharma']","Mental illness is a global health problem, but access to mental healthcare
resources remain poor worldwide. Online peer-to-peer support platforms attempt
to alleviate this fundamental gap by enabling those who struggle with mental
illness to provide and receive social support from their peers. However,
successful social support requires users to engage with each other and failures
may have serious consequences for users in need. Our understanding of
engagement patterns on mental health platforms is limited but critical to
inform the role, limitations, and design of these platforms. Here, we present a
large-scale analysis of engagement patterns of 35 million posts on two popular
online mental health platforms, TalkLife and Reddit. Leveraging communication
models in human-computer interaction and communication theory, we
operationalize a set of four engagement indicators based on attention and
interaction. We then propose a generative model to jointly model these
indicators of engagement, the output of which is synthesized into a novel set
of eleven distinct, interpretable patterns. We demonstrate that this framework
of engagement patterns enables informative evaluations and analysis of online
support platforms. Specifically, we find that mutual back-and-forth
interactions are associated with significantly higher user retention rates on
TalkLife. Such back-and-forth interactions, in turn, are associated with early
response times and the sentiment of posts.",2020,http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.04999v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.04999v1

affected by mental disorders at some point in their lives. However, in many
parts of the world, patients do not actively seek professional diagnosis
because of stigma attached to mental illness, ignorance of mental health and
its associated symptoms. In this paper, we propose a model for passively
detecting mental disorders using conversations on Reddit. Specifically, we
focus on a subset of mental disorders that are characterized by distinct
emotional patterns (henceforth called emotional disorders): major depressive,
anxiety, and bipolar disorders. Through passive (i.e., unprompted) detection,
we can encourage patients to seek diagnosis and treatment for mental disorders.
Our proposed model is different from other work in this area in that our model
is based entirely on the emotional states, and the transition between these
states of users on Reddit, whereas prior work is typically based on
content-based representations (e.g., n-grams, language model embeddings, etc).
We show that content-based representation is affected by domain and topic bias
and thus does not generalize, while our model, on the other hand, suppresses
topic-specific information and thus generalizes well across different topics
and times. We conduct experiments on our model's ability to detect different
emotional disorders and on the generalizability of our model. Our experiments
show that while our model performs comparably to content-based models, such as
BERT, it generalizes much better across time and topic.",2022,http://arxiv.org/abs/2201.09451v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.09451v1

yielded valuable insights. We found that age, gender, and geographical region
of residence were significant demographic factors influencing the likelihood of
developing mental health disorders in post-COVID-19 patients. Additionally,
comorbidities and the severity of COVID-19 illness were important clinical

Clinical Psychology, the social NLP research community addresses the challenge
of automation in mental illness on social media. A recent extension to the
problem of multi-class classification of mental health issues is to identify
the cause behind the user's intention. However, multi-class causal
categorization for mental health issues on social media has a major challenge
of wrong prediction due to the overlapping problem of causal explanations.
There are two possible mitigation techniques to solve this problem: (i)
Inconsistency among causal explanations/ inappropriate human-annotated
inferences in the dataset, (ii) in-depth analysis of arguments and stances in
self-reported text using discourse analysis. In this research work, we
hypothesise that if there exists the inconsistency among F1 scores of different
classes, there must be inconsistency among corresponding causal explanations as
well. In this task, we fine tune the classifiers and find explanations for
multi-class causal categorization of mental illness on social media with LIME
and Integrated Gradient (IG) methods. We test our methods with CAMS dataset and
validate with annotated interpretations. A key contribution of this research

determined through self-reports of emotions; however, there are known issues
with accuracy, bias, and ease of data collection. Recent approaches to
determining emotion dynamics from one's everyday utterances addresses many of
these concerns, but it is not yet known whether these measures of utterance
emotion dynamics (UED) correlate with mental health diagnoses. Here, for the
first time, we study the relationship between tweet emotion dynamics and mental

user's self-disclosed diagnosis. For example: average valence was significantly
higher (i.e., more positive text) in the control group compared to users with
ADHD, MDD, and PTSD. Valence variability was significantly lower in the control
group compared to ADHD, depression, bipolar disorder, MDD, PTSD, and OCD but
not PPD. Rise and recovery rates of valence also exhibited significant

mental health discussions on social media platforms presents research
opportunities to investigate mental health and potentially detect instances of

  Students","['Sara M. González-Betancor', 'Pablo Dorta-González']","PhD students report a higher prevalence of mental illness symptoms than
highly educated individuals in the general population. This situation presents
a serious problem for universities. Thus, the knowledge about this phenomenon
is of great importance in decision-making. In this paper we use the Nature PhD
survey 2019 and estimate several binomial logistic regression models to analyze
the risk of interrupting doctoral studies. This risk is measured through the
desire of change in either the supervisor or the area of expertise, or the wish
of not pursue a PhD. Among the explanatory factors, we focus on the influence
of anxiety/depression, discrimination, and bullying. As control variables we
use demographic characteristics and others related with the doctoral program.
Insufficient contact time with supervisors, and exceeding time spent studying
-crossing the 50-h week barrier-, are risk factors of PhD studies interruption,
but the most decisive risk factor is poor mental health. Universities should
therefore foster an environment of well-being, which allows the development of
autonomy and resilience of their PhD students or, when necessary, which fosters
the development of conflict resolution skills.",2020,http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.07039v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.07039v1

Counterintuitively, these women are more likely to report poor physical health.
As an explanation, we propose purposeful action among women with high agency as
a potential reason, wherein they conceive purpose in the future and formulate
action that is feasible today. Hence, these women prefer to report illness and
get the required treatment to ensure better future health. This illuminates our

Healthcare observations, recorded in electronic medical records, are episodic

current illness states and predicts future medical outcomes. At the data level,
DeepCare represents care episodes as vectors in space, models patient health
state trajectories through explicit memory of historical records. Built on Long
Short-Term Memory (LSTM), DeepCare introduces time parameterizations to handle
irregular timed events by moderating the forgetting and consolidation of memory
cells. DeepCare also incorporates medical interventions that change the course
of illness and shape future medical risk. Moving up to the health state level,
historical and present health states are then aggregated through multiscale
temporal pooling, before passing through a neural network that estimates future
outcomes. We demonstrate the efficacy of DeepCare for disease progression
modeling, intervention recommendation, and future risk prediction. On two

detect mood disorders such as bipolar disorder, a psychiatric condition in
which patients experience drastic mood shifts. Due to the ill-defined nature of

subjective and difficult to pinpoint through short-term surveys and psychiatric
consultations. For many patients, diagnosis and treatment based on
trial-and-error is unavoidable. A timely and thorough diagnosis and treatment
plan is associated with the need for an equal involvement of both the patient

a detailed assessment of current interventions for (i) the ill-defined nature

facilitator that can aid in the appropriate diagnosis and treatment of bipolar

pre-trained Masked Language Models (MLMs) and their downstream sentiment
classification tasks. To evaluate the presence of bias against 93 stigmatized

BERTweet-base, BERTweet-large, and DistilBERT. We use human annotations to
analyze the predicted words from these models, with which we measure the extent
of bias against stigmatized groups. When prompts include stigmatized
conditions, the probability of MLMs predicting negative words is approximately
20 percent higher than when prompts have non-stigmatized conditions. In the
sentiment classification tasks, when sentences include stigmatized conditions
related to diseases, disability, education, and mental illness, they are more
likely to be classified as negative. We also observe a strong correlation

potentiality to be viewed from different perspectives and manifest as different

finetuned on over 150,000 unlabeled posts from Reachout.com. Our top system had
a macro averaged F1 score of 0.572, providing a new state-of-the-art result on

transfer learning is an effective strategy for predicting risk with relatively
little labeled data. We note that finetuning of pretrained language models

  Neural Networks for Mental Illness Diagnosis","['Yanqiao Zhu', 'Hejie Cui', 'Lifang He', 'Lichao Sun', 'Carl Yang']","Multimodal brain networks characterize complex connectivities among different
brain regions from both structural and functional aspects and provide a new
means for mental disease analysis. Recently, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have
become a de facto model for analyzing graph-structured data. However, how to
employ GNNs to extract effective representations from brain networks in
multiple modalities remains rarely explored. Moreover, as brain networks
provide no initial node features, how to design informative node attributes and
leverage edge weights for GNNs to learn is left unsolved. To this end, we
develop a novel multiview GNN for multimodal brain networks. In particular, we
regard each modality as a view for brain networks and employ contrastive
learning for multimodal fusion. Then, we propose a GNN model which takes
advantage of the message passing scheme by propagating messages based on degree

risk of developing mental illnesses. We examined a machine learning-based
method for identification of stress using data collected in a naturalistic
study utilizing self-reported stress as ground truth as well as physiological
data such as heart rate and hand acceleration. The study involved 54 college
students from a large campus who used wearable wrist-worn sensors and a mobile

identifying stress episodes among college students using heart rate and
accelerometer data. The XGBoost method was the most reliable model with an AUC
of 0.64 and an accuracy of 84.5%. The standard deviation of hand acceleration,
standard deviation of heart rate, and the minimum heart rate were the most
important features for stress detection. This evidence may support the efficacy

Major depressive disorder (MDD), is a common mental health disorder that

possible in behaviour makes the problem more challenging. This paper presents a
novel multi-level attention based network for multi-modal depression prediction

intra and inter modality relevance. The multi-level attention reinforces
overall learning by selecting the most influential features within each
modality for the decision making. We perform exhaustive experimentation to

The detection of mental health disorders in the early stages and a precise
diagnosis are critical to avoid social, physiological, or psychological side
effects. This work analyzes physiological signals to observe if different
depressive states have a noticeable impact on the blood volume pulse (BVP) and
the heart rate variability (HRV) response. Although typically, HRV features are
calculated from biosignals obtained with contact-based sensors such as
wearables, we propose instead a novel scheme that directly extracts them from
facial videos, just based on visual information, removing the need for any
contact-based device. Our solution is based on a pipeline that is able to
extract complete remote photoplethysmography signals (rPPG) in a fully
unsupervised manner. We use these rPPG signals to calculate over 60
statistical, geometrical, and physiological features that are further used to
train several machine learning regressors to recognize different levels of
depression. Experiments on two benchmark datasets indicate that this approach

The data showed that 68,315 (71.5\%) participants experienced school bullying
at varying degrees, indicating the prevalence of bullying among adolescents.
The chi-square tests revealed a strong correlation between school bullying and
psychological conditions. This correlation was further explored through
multivariate logistic regression, showing that students who experienced mild
bullying had a 3.10 times higher probability of emotional and behavioral
problems, 4.06 times higher probability of experiencing prodromal symptoms of
mental illness, 4.72 times higher probability of anxiety, 3.28 times higher

and police interaction and understanding of the events leading up to these
adverse outcomes is important. Predictive models may help identify individuals
at risk of such adverse outcomes. Using a fixed observation window cohort with
logistic regression (LR) or machine learning (ML) models can result in lower
performance when compared with adaptive and parcellated windows.
  Method: An administrative healthcare dataset was used, comprising of 240,219
individuals in Calgary, Alberta, Canada who were diagnosed with addiction or
mental health (AMH) between April 1, 2013, and March 31, 2018. The cohort was
followed for 2 years to identify factors associated with homelessness and
police interactions. To understand the benefit of flexible windows to
predictive models, an alternative cohort was created. Then LR and ML models,
including random forests (RF), and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) were
compared in the two cohorts.
  Results: Among 237,602 individuals, 0.8% (1,800) experienced first
homelessness, while 0.32% (759) reported initial police interaction among
237,141 individuals. Male sex (AORs: H=1.51, P=2.52), substance disorder (AORs:
H=3.70, P=2.83), psychiatrist visits (AORs: H=1.44, P=1.49), and drug abuse

Due to online education and remote work, these communities have become central
for academic discussions and support. We classify text as stressed or not using

mental illness,Latent-state models for precision medicine,"['Zekun Xu', 'Eric Laber', 'Ana-Maria Staicu', 'Emanuel Severus']","Observational longitudinal studies are a common means to study treatment
efficacy and safety in chronic mental illness. In many such studies, treatment
changes may be initiated by either the patient or by their clinician and can
thus vary widely across patients in their timing, number, and type. Indeed, in
the observational longitudinal pathway of the STEP-BD study of bipolar
depression, one of the motivations for this work, no two patients have the same
treatment history even after coarsening clinic visits to a weekly time-scale.
Estimation of an optimal treatment regime using such data is challenging as one
cannot naively pool together patients with the same treatment history, as is
required by methods based on inverse probability weighting, nor is it possible
to apply backwards induction over the decision points, as is done in Q-learning
and its variants. Thus, additional structure is needed to effectively pool
information across patients and within a patient over time. Current scientific
theory for many chronic mental illnesses maintains that a patient's disease
status can be conceptualized as transitioning among a small number of discrete
states. We use this theory to inform the construction of a partially observable
Markov decision process model of patient health trajectories wherein observed
health outcomes are dictated by a patient's latent health state. Using this
model, we derive and evaluate estimators of an optimal treatment regime under
two common paradigms for quantifying long-term patient health. The finite
sample performance of the proposed estimator is demonstrated through a series
of simulation experiments and application to the observational pathway of the
STEP-BD study. We find that the proposed method provides high-quality estimates
of an optimal treatment strategy in settings where existing approaches cannot
be applied without ad hoc modifications.",2020,http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.13001v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.13001v2

individuals worldwide. Early detection and timely intervention are crucial for
promoting remission, preventing relapse, and alleviating the emotional and
financial burdens associated with depression. However, patients with depression
often go undiagnosed in the primary care setting. Unlike many physiological
illnesses, depression lacks objective indicators for recognizing depression
risk, and existing methods for depression risk recognition are time-consuming
and often encounter a shortage of trained medical professionals. The
correlation between gait and depression risk has been empirically established.
Gait can serve as a promising objective biomarker, offering the advantage of
efficient and convenient data collection. However, current methods for
recognizing depression risk based on gait have only been validated on small,
private datasets, lacking large-scale publicly available datasets for research
purposes. Additionally, these methods are primarily limited to hand-crafted
approaches. Gait is a complex form of motion, and hand-crafted gait features
often only capture a fraction of the intricate associations between gait and
depression risk. Therefore, this study first constructs a large-scale gait
database, encompassing over 1,200 individuals, 40,000 gait sequences, and
covering six perspectives and three types of attire. Two commonly used
psychological scales are provided as depression risk annotations. Subsequently,
a deep learning-based depression risk recognition model is proposed, overcoming
the limitations of hand-crafted approaches. Through experiments conducted on

whether and how social attitudes are represented in ML models. In particular,
representations encoded in models often inadvertently perpetuate undesirable
social biases from the data on which they are trained. In this paper, we
present evidence of such undesirable biases towards mentions of disability in
two different English language models: toxicity prediction and sentiment
analysis. Next, we demonstrate that the neural embeddings that are the critical
first step in most NLP pipelines similarly contain undesirable biases towards
mentions of disability. We end by highlighting topical biases in the discourse

underlying causes and correlates of chronic physical illnesses and mental

stress with a dataset of 601 social media users, who answered the Perceived
Stress Scale questionnaire and also consented to share their Facebook and
Twitter data. Firstly, we find that stressed users post about exhaustion,
losing control, increased self-focus and physical pain as compared to posts
about breakfast, family-time, and travel by users who are not stressed.
Secondly, we find that Facebook language is more predictive of stress than
Twitter language. Thirdly, we demonstrate how the language based models thus
developed can be adapted and be scaled to measure county-level trends. Since
county-level language is easily available on Twitter using the Streaming API,
we explore multiple domain adaptation algorithms to adapt user-level Facebook

media-based measurements of stress outperform sociodemographic variables (age,
gender, race, education, and income), against ground-truth survey-based stress
measurements, both at the user- and the county-level in the U.S. Twitter

mental illness,"Towards a science of human stories: using sentiment analysis and
  emotional arcs to understand the building blocks of complex social systems",['Andrew J. Reagan'],"Given the growing assortment of sentiment measuring instruments, it is
imperative to understand which aspects of sentiment dictionaries contribute to
both their classification accuracy and their ability to provide richer
understanding of texts. Here, we perform detailed, quantitative tests and
qualitative assessments of 6 dictionary-based methods applied, and briefly
examine a further 20 methods. We show that while inappropriate for sentences,
dictionary-based methods are generally robust in their classification accuracy
for longer texts.
  Stories often following distinct emotional trajectories, forming patterns
that are meaningful to us. By classifying the emotional arcs for a filtered
subset of 4,803 stories from Project Gutenberg's fiction collection, we find a
set of six core trajectories which form the building blocks of complex
narratives. Of profound scientific interest will be the degree to which we can
eventually understand the full landscape of human stories, and data driven
approaches will play a crucial role.
  Finally, we utilize web-scale data from Twitter to study the limits of what
social data can tell us about public health, mental illness, discourse around
the protest movement of #BlackLivesMatter, discourse around climate change, and
hidden networks. We conclude with a review of published works in complex

mental illness,Mining Hidden Populations through Attributed Search,"['Suhansanu Kumar', 'Heting Gao', 'Changyu Wang', 'Hari Sundaram', 'Kevin Chen-Chuan Chang']","Researchers often query online social platforms through their application
programming interfaces (API) to find target populations such as people with
mental illness~\cite{De-Choudhury2017} and jazz
musicians~\cite{heckathorn2001finding}. Entities of such target population
satisfy a property that is typically identified using an oracle (human or a
pre-trained classifier). When the property of the target entities is not
directly queryable via the API, we refer to the property as `hidden' and the
population as a hidden population. Finding individuals who belong to these
populations on social networks is hard because they are non-queryable, and the
sampler has to explore from a combinatorial query space within a finite budget
limit. By exploiting the correlation between queryable attributes and the
population of interest and by hierarchically ordering the query space, we
propose a Decision tree-based Thompson sampler (\texttt{DT-TMP}) that
efficiently discovers the right combination of attributes to query. Our
proposed sampler outperforms the state-of-the-art samplers in online
experiments, for example by 54\% on Twitter. When the number of matching
entities to a query is known in offline experiments, \texttt{DT-TMP} performs
exceedingly well by a factor of 0.9-1.5$\times$ over the baseline samplers. In
the future, we wish to explore the option of finding hidden populations by
formulating more complex queries.",2019,http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.04505v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.04505v1
mental illness,"When to Intervene: Detecting Abnormal Mood using Everyday Smartphone
  Conversations","['John Gideon', 'Katie Matton', 'Steve Anderau', 'Melvin G McInnis', 'Emily Mower Provost']","Bipolar disorder (BPD) is a chronic mental illness characterized by extreme
mood and energy changes from mania to depression. These changes drive behaviors
that often lead to devastating personal or social consequences. BPD is managed
clinically with regular interactions with care providers, who assess mood,
energy levels, and the form and content of speech. Recent work has proposed
smartphones for monitoring mood using speech. However, these works do not
predict when to intervene. Predicting when to intervene is challenging because
there is not a single measure that is relevant for every person: different
individuals may have different levels of symptom severity considered typical.
Additionally, this typical mood, or baseline, may change over time, making a
single symptom threshold insufficient. This work presents an innovative
approach that expands clinical mood monitoring to predict when interventions
are necessary using an anomaly detection framework, which we call Temporal
Normalization. We first validate the model using a dataset annotated for
clinical interventions and then incorporate this method in a deep learning
framework to predict mood anomalies from natural, unstructured, telephone
speech data. The combination of these approaches provides a framework to enable
real-world speech-focused mood monitoring.",2019,http://arxiv.org/abs/1909.11248v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.11248v2

  Electronic Medical Records","['Phuoc Nguyen', 'Truyen Tran', 'Svetha Venkatesh']","Modern healthcare is ripe for disruption by AI. A game changer would be
automatic understanding the latent processes from electronic medical records,
which are being collected for billions of people worldwide. However, these
healthcare processes are complicated by the interaction between at least three
dynamic components: the illness which involves multiple diseases, the care
which involves multiple treatments, and the recording practice which is biased
and erroneous. Existing methods are inadequate in capturing the dynamic
structure of care. We propose Resset, an end-to-end recurrent model that reads
medical record and predicts future risk. The model adopts the algebraic view in
that discrete medical objects are embedded into continuous vectors lying in the
same space. We formulate the problem as modeling sequences of sets, a novel
setting that have rarely, if not, been addressed. Within Resset, the bag of
diseases recorded at each clinic visit is modeled as function of sets. The same
hold for the bag of treatments. The interaction between the disease bag and the
treatment bag at a visit is modeled in several, one of which as residual of
diseases minus the treatments. Finally, the health trajectory, which is a
sequence of visits, is modeled using a recurrent neural network. We report
results on over a hundred thousand hospital visits by patients suffered from
two costly chronic diseases -- diabetes and mental health. Resset shows
promises in multiple predictive tasks such as readmission prediction,
treatments recommendation and diseases progression.",2018,http://arxiv.org/abs/1802.00948v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.00948v1

  A Case Study on Emotion Regulation","['Mawulolo K. Ameko', 'Miranda L. Beltzer', 'Lihua Cai', 'Mehdi Boukhechba', 'Bethany A. Teachman', 'Laura E. Barnes']","Delivering treatment recommendations via pervasive electronic devices such as
mobile phones has the potential to be a viable and scalable treatment medium
for long-term health behavior management. But active experimentation of
treatment options can be time-consuming, expensive and altogether unethical in
some cases. There is a growing interest in methodological approaches that allow
an experimenter to learn and evaluate the usefulness of a new treatment
strategy before deployment. We present the first development of a treatment
recommender system for emotion regulation using real-world historical mobile
digital data from n = 114 high socially anxious participants to test the
usefulness of new emotion regulation strategies. We explore a number of offline
contextual bandits estimators for learning and propose a general framework for
learning algorithms. Our experimentation shows that the proposed doubly robust
offline learning algorithms performed significantly better than baseline
approaches, suggesting that this type of recommender algorithm could improve
emotion regulation. Given that emotion regulation is impaired across many
mental illnesses and such a recommender algorithm could be scaled up easily,
this approach holds potential to increase access to treatment for many people.
We also share some insights that allow us to translate contextual bandit models
to this complex real-world data, including which contextual features appear to
be most important for predicting emotion regulation strategy effectiveness.",2020,http://arxiv.org/abs/2008.09472v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.09472v1
mental illness,Dynamic Brain Functional Networks Guided By Anatomical Knowledge,"['Suprateek Kundu', 'Jin Ming', 'Jennifer Stevens']","Recently, the potential of dynamic brain networks as a neuroimaging
biomarkers for mental illnesses is being increasingly recognized. However,
there are several unmet challenges in developing such biomarkers, including the
need for methods to model rapidly changing network states. In one of the first
such efforts, we develop a novel approach for computing dynamic brain
functional connectivity (FC), that is guided by brain structural connectivity
(SC) computed from diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) data. The proposed approach
involving dynamic Gaussian graphical models decomposes the time course into
non-overlapping state phases determined by change points, each having a
distinct network. We develop an optimization algorithm to implement the method
such that the estimation of both the change points and the state-phase specific
networks are fully data driven and unsupervised, and guided by SC information.
The approach is scalable to large dimensions and extensive simulations
illustrate its clear advantages over existing methods in terms of network
estimation accuracy and detecting dynamic network changes. An application of
the method to a posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) study reveals important
dynamic resting state connections in regions of the brain previously implicated
in PTSD. We also illustrate that the dynamic networks computed under the
proposed method are able to better predict psychological resilience among
trauma exposed individuals compared to existing dynamic and stationary
connectivity approaches, which highlights its potential as a neuroimaging
biomarker.",2019,http://arxiv.org/abs/1910.03577v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1910.03577v1

Through efforts to automate and systematize diagnosis of mental illnesses over

the eye and head signals extracted from our unique dataset, this study finds
that high-risk suicidal individuals experience psycho-motor retardation and

motivated by an intention-to-treat study of the relative cardiometabolic risk
of assignment to one of six commonly prescribed antipsychotic drugs in a cohort

estimators, such as targeted minimum loss-based estimation (TMLE), require
correct specification of either the treatment model or outcome model to ensure
consistent estimation; however, common TMLE implementations estimate treatment
probabilities using multiple binomial regressions rather than multinomial
regression. We implement a TMLE estimator that uses multinomial treatment
assignment and ensemble machine learning to estimate average treatment effects.
Our multinomial implementation improves coverage, but does not necessarily
reduce bias, relative to the binomial implementation in simulation experiments
with varying treatment propensity overlap and event rates. Evaluating the
causal effects of the antipsychotics on three-year diabetes risk or death, we
find a safety benefit of moving from a second-generation drug considered among

  Networks and Transformers Utilizing EEG Signals","['Abdolkarim Saeedi', 'Arash Maghsoudi', 'Fereidoun Nowshiravan Rahatabad']","The Early diagnosis and treatment of depression is essential for effective
treatment. Depression, while being one of the most common mental illnesses, is
still poorly understood in both research and clinical practice. Among different
treatments, drug prescription is widely used, however the drug treatment is not
effective for many patients. In this work, we propose a method for major
depressive disorder (MDD) diagnosis as well as a method for predicting the drug
response in patient with MDD using EEG signals. Method: We employ transformers,
which are modified recursive neural networks with novel architecture to
evaluate the time dependency of time series effectively. We also compare the
model to the well-known deep learning schemes such as CNN, LSTM and CNN-LSTM.
Results: The transformer achieves an average recall of 99.41% and accuracy of
97.14% for classifying normal and MDD subjects. Furthermore, the transformer
also performed well in classifying responders and non-responders to the drug,
resulting in 97.01% accuracy and 97.76% Recall. Conclusion: Outperforming other
methods on a similar number of parameters, the suggested technique, as a
screening tool, seems to have the potential to assist health care professionals
in assessing MDD patients for early diagnosis and treatment. Significance:
Analyzing EEG signal analysis using transformers, which have replaced the

grave financial and societal ramifications. Depression detection is key for
early intervention to mitigate those consequences. Such a high-stake decision

result also reveals new symptoms that are unnoted in the survey approach, such
as sharing admiration for a different life. We further conduct a user study to
demonstrate its superiority over the benchmarks in interpretability. This study

categorization of individuals with Schizophrenia, using the dataset having
motor activity recordings of 22 Schizophrenia patients and 32 control subjects.
The dataset contains per-minute motor activity measurements collected for an
average of 12.7 days in a row for each participant. We dissect each day into
segments (Twelve, Eight, six, four, three, and two parts) and evaluate their
impact on classification. We employ sixteen statistical features within these
temporal segments and train them on Seven machine learning models to get deeper
insights. LightGBM model outperforms the other six models. Our results indicate
that the temporal segmentation significantly improves the classification, with
AUC-ROC = 0.93, F1 score = 0.84( LightGBM- without any segmentation) and
AUC-ROC = 0.98, F1 score = 0.93( LightGBM- with segmentation). Distinguishing
between diurnal and nocturnal segments amplifies the differences between
Schizophrenia patients and controls. However, further subdivisions into smaller
time segments do not affect the AUC- ROC significantly. Morning, afternoon,
evening, and night partitioning gives similar classification performance to
day-night partitioning. These findings are valuable as they indicate that
extensive temporal classification beyond distinguishing between day and night

activity. Here, we compare the explanation performance of prominent
interpretation methods in a mental state decoding analysis of three functional
Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) datasets. Our findings demonstrate a gradient
between two key characteristics of an explanation in mental state decoding,
namely, its biological plausibility and faithfulness: interpretation methods
with high explanation faithfulness, which capture the model's decision process
well, generally provide explanations that are biologically less plausible than
the explanations of interpretation methods with less explanation faithfulness.
Based on this finding, we provide specific recommendations for the application
of interpretation methods in mental state decoding.",2022,http://arxiv.org/abs/2205.15581v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.15581v2

  Posts","['Sajad Sotudeh', 'Nazli Goharian', 'Zachary Young']","Mental health remains a significant challenge of public health worldwide.
With increasing popularity of online platforms, many use the platforms to share
their mental health conditions, express their feelings, and seek help from the
community and counselors. Some of these platforms, such as Reachout, are
dedicated forums where the users register to seek help. Others such as Reddit
provide subreddits where the users publicly but anonymously post their mental
health distress. Although posts are of varying length, it is beneficial to
provide a short, but informative summary for fast processing by the counselors.
To facilitate research in summarization of mental health online posts, we
introduce Mental Health Summarization dataset, MentSum, containing over 24k
carefully selected user posts from Reddit, along with their short user-written
summary (called TLDR) in English from 43 mental health subreddits. This
domain-specific dataset could be of interest not only for generating short
summaries on Reddit, but also for generating summaries of posts on the
dedicated mental health forums such as Reachout. We further evaluate both
extractive and abstractive state-of-the-art summarization baselines in terms of
Rouge scores, and finally conduct an in-depth human evaluation study of both
user-written and system-generated summaries, highlighting challenges in this
research.",2022,http://arxiv.org/abs/2206.00856v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.00856v1

  policies on economic and mental distress","['Reka Sundaram-Stukel', 'Richard J Davidson']","Background The COVID-19 pandemic has increased mental distress globally. The
proportion of people reporting anxiety is 26%, and depression is 34% points.
Disentangling associational and causal contributions of behavior, COVID-19
cases, and economic distress on mental distress will dictate different
mitigation strategies to reduce long-term pandemic-related mental distress.
Methods We use the Household Pulse Survey (HPS) April 2020 to February 2021
data to examine mental distress among U.S. citizens attributable to COVID-19.
We combined HPS survey data with publicly available state-level weekly:
COVID-19 case and death data from the Centers for Disease Control, public
policies, and Apple and Google mobility data. Finally, we constructed economic
and mental distress measures to estimate structural models with lag dependent
variables to tease out public health policies' associational and causal path
coefficients on economic and mental distress. Findings From April 2020 to
February 2021, we found that anxiety and depression had steadily climbed in the
U.S. By design, mobility restrictions primarily affected public health policies
where businesses and restaurants absorbed the biggest hit. Period t-1 COVID-19
cases increased job loss by 4.1% and economic distress by 6.3% points in the
same period. Job-loss and housing insecurity in t-1 increased period t mental
distress by 29.1% and 32.7%, respectively. However, t-1 food insecurity
decreased mental distress by 4.9% in time t. The pandemic-related potential
causal path coefficient of period t-1 economic distress on period t depression
is 57.8%, and anxiety is 55.9%. Thus, we show that period t-1 COVID-19 case
information, behavior, and economic distress may be causally associated with
pandemic related period t mental distress.",2021,http://arxiv.org/abs/2112.11564v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.11564v1

  Imaging Genomics","['Alexej Gossmann', 'Pascal Zille', 'Vince Calhoun', 'Yu-Ping Wang']","Reducing the number of false discoveries is presently one of the most
pressing issues in the life sciences. It is of especially great importance for
many applications in neuroimaging and genomics, where datasets are typically
high-dimensional, which means that the number of explanatory variables exceeds
the sample size. The false discovery rate (FDR) is a criterion that can be
employed to address that issue. Thus it has gained great popularity as a tool
for testing multiple hypotheses. Canonical correlation analysis (CCA) is a
statistical technique that is used to make sense of the cross-correlation of
two sets of measurements collected on the same set of samples (e.g., brain
imaging and genomic data for the same mental illness patients), and sparse CCA
extends the classical method to high-dimensional settings. Here we propose a
way of applying the FDR concept to sparse CCA, and a method to control the FDR.
The proposed FDR correction directly influences the sparsity of the solution,
adapting it to the unknown true sparsity level. Theoretical derivation as well
as simulation studies show that our procedure indeed keeps the FDR of the
canonical vectors below a user-specified target level. We apply the proposed
method to an imaging genomics dataset from the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental
Cohort. Our results link the brain connectivity profiles derived from brain
activity during an emotion identification task, as measured by functional
magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), to the corresponding subjects' genomic data.",2017,http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.04312v4,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1705.04312v4

Gur', 'Raquel E. Gur', 'Theodore D. Satterthwaite', 'Danielle S. Bassett']","Higher socioeconomic status (SES) in childhood is associated with increased
cognitive abilities, higher academic achievement, and decreased incidence of
mental illness later in development. Accumulating evidence suggests that these
effects may be due to changes in brain development induced by environmental
factors. While prior work has mapped the associations between neighborhood SES
and brain structure, little is known about the relationship between SES and
intrinsic neural dynamics. Here, we capitalize upon a large community-based
sample (Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort, ages 8-22 years, n=1012) to
examine developmental changes in functional brain network topology as estimated
from resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging data. We
quantitatively characterize this topology using a local measure of network
segregation known as the clustering coefficient, and find that it accounts for
a greater degree of SES-associated variance than meso-scale segregation
captured by modularity. While whole-brain clustering increased with age,
high-SES youth displayed faster increases in clustering than low-SES youth, and
this effect was most pronounced for regions in the limbic, somatomotor, and
ventral attention systems. The effect of SES on developmental increases in
clustering was strongest for connections of intermediate physical length,
consistent with faster decreases in local connectivity in these regions in
low-SES youth, and tracked changes in BOLD signal complexity in the form of
regional homogeneity. Our findings suggest that neighborhood SES may
fundamentally alter intrinsic patterns of inter-regional interactions in the
human brain in a manner that is consistent with greater segregation of

predicting when someone will attempt suicide has been nearly impossible. In the
modern world, many individuals suffering from mental illness seek emotional
support and advice on well-known and easily-accessible social media platforms
such as Reddit. While prior artificial intelligence research has demonstrated
the ability to extract valuable information from social media on suicidal
thoughts and behaviors, these efforts have not considered both severity and
temporality of risk. The insights made possible by access to such data have
enormous clinical potential - most dramatically envisioned as a trigger to
employ timely and targeted interventions (i.e., voluntary and involuntary
psychiatric hospitalization) to save lives. In this work, we address this
knowledge gap by developing deep learning algorithms to assess suicide risk in
terms of severity and temporality from Reddit data based on the Columbia
Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS). In particular, we employ two deep
learning approaches: time-variant and time-invariant modeling, for user-level
suicide risk assessment, and evaluate their performance against a
clinician-adjudicated gold standard Reddit corpus annotated based on the
C-SSRS. Our results suggest that the time-variant approach outperforms the
time-invariant method in the assessment of suicide-related ideations and

complementary information and highlight different perspectives, albeit each
with their own limitations. A focus on a single modality may lead to incorrect
inferences, which is especially important when a studied phenomenon is a
disease. In this paper, we introduce a method that takes advantage of
multimodal data in addressing the hypotheses of disconnectivity and dysfunction
within schizophrenia (SZ). Methods: We start with estimating and visualizing
links within and among extracted multimodal data features using a Gaussian
graphical model (GGM). We then propose a modularity-based method that can be
applied to the GGM to identify links that are associated with mental illness
across a multimodal data set. Through simulation and real data, we show our
approach reveals important information about disease-related network
disruptions that are missed with a focus on a single modality. We use
functional MRI (fMRI), diffusion MRI (dMRI), and structural MRI (sMRI) to
compute the fractional amplitude of low frequency fluctuations (fALFF),
fractional anisotropy (FA), and gray matter (GM) concentration maps. These
three modalities are analyzed using our modularity method. Results: Our results
show missing links that are only captured by the cross-modal information that
may play an important role in disconnectivity between the components.
Conclusion: We identified multimodal (fALFF, FA and GM) disconnectivity in the
default mode network area in patients with SZ, which would not have been
detectable in a single modality. Significance: The proposed approach provides
an important new tool for capturing information that is distributed among
multiple imaging modalities.",2020,http://arxiv.org/abs/2001.01707v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2001.01707v1

understanding which kinds of patients respond best to specific treatments -- in
other words, treatment effect heterogeneity. Recently, there has been a
proliferation of methods for estimating the ODTR. One such method is an
extension of the SuperLearner algorithm -- an ensemble method to optimally
combine candidate algorithms extensively used in prediction problems -- to
ODTRs. Following the ""causal roadmap,"" we causally and statistically define the
ODTR and provide an introduction to estimating it using the ODTR SuperLearner.
Additionally, we highlight practical choices when implementing the algorithm,
including choice of candidate algorithms, metalearners to combine the
candidates, and risk functions to select the best combination of algorithms.
Using simulations, we illustrate how estimating the ODTR using this
SuperLearner approach can uncover treatment effect heterogeneity more
effectively than traditional approaches based on fitting a parametric
regression of the outcome on the treatment, covariates and treatment-covariate
interactions. We investigate the implications of choices in implementing an
ODTR SuperLearner at various sample sizes. Our results show the advantages of:
(1) including a combination of both flexible machine learning algorithms and
simple parametric estimators in the library of candidate algorithms; (2) using
an ensemble metalearner to combine candidates rather than selecting only the
best-performing candidate; (3) using the mean outcome under the rule as a risk

study the performance of estimators that approximate the true value of: 1) an
$a$ $priori$ known dynamic treatment rule 2) the true, unknown optimal dynamic
treatment rule (ODTR); 3) an estimated ODTR, a so-called ""data-adaptive

point-treatment data, we specifically investigate: 1) the impact of
increasingly data-adaptive estimation of nuisance parameters and/or of the ODTR
on performance; 2) the potential for improved efficiency and bias reduction
through the use of semiparametric efficient estimators; and, 3) the importance
of sample splitting based on CV-TMLE for accurate inference. In the simulations
considered, there was very little cost and many benefits to using the
cross-validated targeted maximum likelihood estimator (CV-TMLE) to estimate the

highly data-adaptive algorithms were used to estimate both nuisance parameters

data. Learning the non-linear representations is done using a variational
autoencoder (VAE). The VAE is trained on voxelwise rs-fMRI data and performs
non-linear dimensionality reduction that retains meaningful information. The
retention of information in the model's representations is evaluated using
downstream age regression and sex classification tasks. The results on these
tasks are highly encouraging and a linear regressor trained with the
representations of our unsupervised model performs almost as well as a
supervised neural network, trained specifically for age regression on the same
dataset. The model is also evaluated with a schizophrenia diagnosis prediction
task, to assess its feasibility as a dimensionality reduction method for
neuropsychiatric datasets. These results highlight the potential for
pre-training on a larger set of individuals who do not have mental illness, to
improve the downstream neuropsychiatric task results. The pre-trained model is
fine-tuned for a variable number of epochs on a schizophrenia dataset and we
find that fine-tuning for 1 epoch yields the best results. This work therefore
not only opens up non-linear dimensionality reduction for voxelwise rs-fMRI
data but also shows that pre-training a deep learning model on voxelwise
rs-fMRI datasets greatly increases performance even on smaller datasets. It
also opens up the ability to look at the distribution of rs-fMRI time series in
the latent space of the VAE for heterogeneous neuropsychiatric disorders like
schizophrenia in future work. This can be complemented with the generative

accuracy, comprehensibility, and 3D global explanations needed in neuroimaging
and beyond. To address this gap, we developed an explainable artificial
intelligence (XAI) 3D-Framework capable of providing accurate, low-complexity
global explanations. We evaluated the framework using various 3D deep learning
models trained on a well-annotated cohort of 596 structural MRIs. The binary
classification task focused on detecting the presence or absence of the
paracingulate sulcus, a highly variable brain structure associated with

combining Shape, GradCam, and SHAP, our framework reduces inter-method

However, existing work in this sphere has only shown support for mental health

them learn relevant skills. We hypothesize that humans can also get help from
social robots in mental well-being by releasing or sharing their mental health
data with the social robots. In this paper, we present a human-robot
interaction (HRI) study to evaluate this hypothesis. During the five-day study,
a total of fifty-five (n=55) participants shared their in-the-moment mood and

mental illness,"The Role of Mandated Mental Health Treatment in the Criminal Justice
  System",['Rachel Nesbit'],"Mental health disorders are particularly prevalent among those in the
criminal justice system and may be a contributing factor in recidivism. Using
North Carolina court cases from 1994 to 2009, this paper evaluates how mandated
mental health treatment as a term of probation impacts the likelihood that
individuals return to the criminal justice system. I use random variation in
judge assignment to compare those who were required to seek weekly mental
health counseling to those who were not. The main findings are that being
assigned to seek mental health treatment decreases the likelihood of three-year
recidivism by about 12 percentage points, or 36 percent. This effect persists
over time, and is similar among various types of individuals on probation. In
addition, I show that mental health treatment operates distinctly from drug
addiction interventions in a multiple-treatment framework. I provide evidence
that mental health treatment's longer-term effectiveness is strongest among
more financially-advantaged probationers, consistent with this setting, in
which the cost of mandated treatment is shouldered by offenders. Finally,
conservative calculations result in a 5:1 benefit-to-cost ratio which suggests
that the treatment-induced decrease in future crime would be more than
sufficient to offset the costs of treatment.",2022,http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.06736v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.06736v2

with noises such as ocular artifacts (OAs) and muscle artifacts (MAs), which
deteriorate the hand-crafted features extracted from EEG signal, resulting
inadequate identification and classification of mental tasks. Therefore, we
investigate the use of recent deep learning techniques which do not require any

of the proposed architecture is evaluated using artifact-free and

Moderation can improve online discourse quality, but we lack an understanding

navigating in a simulated environment and gathering visual information to
answer questions. Existing approaches fail to explicitly model the mental
imagery function of the agent, while the mental imagery is crucial to embodied
cognition, and has a close relation to many high-level meta-skills such as
generalization and interpretation. In this paper, we propose a novel Mental
Imagery eNhanceD (MIND) module for the embodied agent, as well as a relevant
deep reinforcement framework for training. The MIND module can not only model
the dynamics of the environment (e.g. 'what might happen if the agent passes
through a door') but also help the agent to create a better understanding of
the environment (e.g. 'The refrigerator is usually in the kitchen'). Such
knowledge makes the agent a faster and better learner in locating a feasible
policy with only a few trails. Furthermore, the MIND module can generate mental
images that are treated as short-term subgoals by our proposed deep
reinforcement framework. These mental images facilitate policy learning since
short-term subgoals are easy to achieve and reusable. This yields better
planning efficiency than other algorithms that learn a policy directly from
primitive actions. Finally, the mental images visualize the agent's intentions
in a way that human can understand, and this endows our agent's actions with
more interpretability. The experimental results and further analysis prove that
the agent with the MIND module is superior to its counterparts not only in EQA

  Clinical Well-Being","['Anna Fang', 'Wenjie Yang', 'Raj Sanjay Shah', 'Yash Mathur', 'Diyi Yang', 'Haiyi Zhu', 'Robert Kraut']","Online mental health support communities have grown in recent years for
providing accessible mental and emotional health support through volunteer
counselors. Despite millions of people participating in chat support on these
platforms, the clinical effectiveness of these communities on mental health
symptoms remains unknown. Furthermore, although volunteers receive some
training based on established therapeutic skills studied in face-to-face
environments such as active listening and motivational interviewing, it remains
understudied how the usage of these skills in this online context affects
people's mental health status. In our work, we collaborate with one of the
largest online peer support platforms and use both natural language processing
and machine learning techniques to measure how one-on-one support chats affect
depression and anxiety symptoms. We measure how the techniques and
characteristics of support providers, such as using affirmation, empathy, and
past experience on the platform, affect support-seekers' mental health changes.
We find that online peer support chats improve both depression and anxiety
symptoms with a statistically significant but relatively small effect size.
Additionally, support providers' techniques such as emphasizing the autonomy of
the client lead to better mental health outcomes. However, we also found that
some behaviors (e.g. persuading) are actually harmful to depression and anxiety
outcomes. Our work provides key understanding for mental health care in the

accurately capture how neighborhood greenery is perceived on the ground. To
examine: 1) how streetscape and remote sensing-based greenery affect people's
mental wellbeing in Guangzhou, China; 2) whether and, if so, to what extent the
associations are mediated by physical activity, stress, air quality and noise,
and social cohesion; and 3) whether differences in the mediation across the
streetscape greenery and NDVI exposure metrics occurred. Mental wellbeing was
quantified by the WHO-5 wellbeing index. Greenery measures were extracted at
the neighborhood level: 1) streetscape greenery from street view data via a
convolutional neural network, and 2) the NDVI remote sensing images. Single and
multiple mediation analyses with multilevel regressions were conducted.
Streetscape and NDVI greenery were weakly and positively, but not
significantly, correlated. Our regression results revealed that streetscape
greenery and NDVI were, individually and jointly, positively associated with
mental wellbeing. Significant partial mediators for the streetscape greenery
were physical activity, stress, air quality and noise, and social cohesion;
together, they explained 62% of the association. For NDVI, only physical
activity and social cohesion were significant partial mediators, accounting for
22% of the association. Mental health and wellbeing and both streetscape and

climate change was not influential, what factors were important for predicting
financial wellbeing of the farm. And third, ascertain whether observed effects
on the financial wellbeing of the farm were a result of interactions between

climate change factors, namely increases in temperature and reductions in
precipitation, can regionally impact self-perceived financial wellbeing of

precipitation can have a measurable negative impact on the financial wellbeing
of farms in Chile. This effect is less pronounced in Tunisia. Climate impact
differences were observed within Chile but not in Tunisia. However, climate
change is only of minor importance for predicting farm financial wellbeing,

detailed data about individual activities and group interactions that are
otherwise difficult to capture. A hopeful application of these technologies is
that they can help businesses and workers optimize productivity and wellbeing.
However, given the workplace's inherent and structural power dynamics, the
prevalent approach of accepting tacit compliance to monitor work activities
rather than seeking workers' meaningful consent raises privacy and ethical
concerns. This paper unpacks the challenges workers face when consenting to
workplace wellbeing technologies. Using a hypothetical case to prompt
reflection among six multi-stakeholder focus groups involving 15 participants,
we explored participants' expectations and capacity to consent to these
technologies. We sketched possible interventions that could better support
meaningful consent to workplace wellbeing technologies by drawing on critical
computing and feminist scholarship -- which reframes consent from a purely
individual choice to a structural condition experienced at the individual level
that needs to be freely given, reversible, informed, enthusiastic, and specific
(FRIES). The focus groups revealed how workers are vulnerable to ""meaningless""
consent -- as they may be subject to power dynamics that minimize their ability
to withhold consent and may thus experience an erosion of autonomy, also
undermining the value of data gathered in the name of ""wellbeing."" To
meaningfully consent, participants wanted changes to the technology and to the
policies and practices surrounding the technology. Our mapping of what prevents
workers from meaningfully consenting to workplace wellbeing technologies
(challenges) and what they require to do so (interventions) illustrates how the
lack of meaningful consent is a structural problem requiring socio-technical

transfer, merging the content of one image (e.g., a photo) with the style of
another (e.g., a painting). Our research shows this concept can be extended to
analyse the design of streetscapes in relation to health and wellbeing
outcomes. An Australian population health survey (n=34,000) was used to
identify the spatial distribution of health and wellbeing outcomes, including
general health and social capital. For each outcome, the most and least
desirable locations formed two domains. Streetscape design was sampled using
around 80,000 Google Street View images per domain. Generative adversarial
networks translated these images from one domain to the other, preserving the
main structure of the input image, but transforming the `style' from locations
where self-reported health was bad to locations where it was good. These
translations indicate that areas in Melbourne with good general health are
characterised by sufficient green space and compactness of the urban

contained more and wider footpaths, fewer fences and more grass. Beyond
identifying relationships, the method is a first step towards

  psychological and social wellbeing: a pilot trial","['Marcos Baez', 'Iman Khaghani Far', 'Francisco Ibarra', 'Michela Ferron', 'Daniele Didino', 'Fabio Casati']","Background. There are many factors that can make of group exercises a
challenging setting for older adults. A major one in the elderly population is
the difference in the level of skills. In this paper we report on the physical,
psychological and social wellbeing outcomes of a novel virtual gym that enables
online group-exercises in older adults with different levels of skills.
  Methods. A total of 37 older adults (65-87 years old) followed a personalized
exercise program based on the OTAGO program for fall prevention, for a period
of eight weeks. Participants could join online group exercises using a
tablet-based application. Participants were assigned either to a Control group
(individual training) or Social group (online group-exercising). Pre- and post-
measurements were taken to analyze the physical, psychological and social
wellbeing outcomes. The study received ethical approval from the CREATE-NET
Ethics Committee on ICT Research Involving Human Beings (Application N.
2014-001).
  Results. There were improvements in both the Social and Control groups in
terms of physical outcomes. Interestingly though, while in the Control group
fitter individuals tended to adhere more to the training, this was not the case
for the Social group, where the initial level had no effect on adherence. For
psychological and social wellbeing outcomes there were improvements on both
groups, regardless of the application used.
  Conclusion. Group exercising in a virtual gym can be effective in motivating
and enabling individuals who are less fit to train as much as fitter
individuals. This not only indicates the feasibility of training together
despite differences in physical skills but also suggests that online exercise
can reduce the effect of skills on adherence in a social context. Longer term
interventions with more participants are instead recommended to assess impacts

As a novel coronavirus swept the world in early 2020, thousands of

effects of the pandemic on developers' wellbeing and productivity. Method. A
questionnaire survey was created mainly from existing, validated scales and
translated into 12 languages. The data was analyzed using non-parametric
inferential statistics and structural equation modeling. Results. The

supported the validity of the scales and the structural model achieved a good
fit (CFI = 0.961, RMSEA = 0.051, SRMR = 0.067). Confirmatory results include:

wellbeing,"The econometrics of happiness: Are we underestimating the returns to
  education and income?",['Christopher P Barrington-Leigh'],"This paper describes a fundamental and empirically conspicuous problem
inherent to surveys of human feelings and opinions in which subjective
responses are elicited on numerical scales. The paper also proposes a solution.
The problem is a tendency by some individuals -- particularly those with low
levels of education -- to simplify the response scale by considering only a
subset of possible responses such as the lowest, middle, and highest. In
principle, this ``focal value rounding'' (FVR) behavior renders invalid even
the weak ordinality assumption often used in analysis of such data. With
``happiness'' or life satisfaction data as an example, descriptive methods and
a multinomial logit model both show that the effect is large and that education
and, to a lesser extent, income level are predictors of FVR behavior.
  A model simultaneously accounting for the underlying wellbeing and for the
degree of FVR is able to estimate the latent subjective wellbeing, i.e.~the
counterfactual full-scale responses for all respondents, the biases associated
with traditional estimates, and the fraction of respondents who exhibit FVR.
Addressing this problem helps to resolve a longstanding puzzle in the life
satisfaction literature, namely that the returns to education, after adjusting
for income, appear to be small or negative. Due to the same econometric
problem, the marginal utility of income in a subjective wellbeing sense has
been consistently underestimated.",2018,http://arxiv.org/abs/1807.11835v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1807.11835v3

  Multi-Modal Mental Wellbeing Classification","['Kieran Woodward', 'Eiman Kanjo', 'Athanasios Tsanas']","The quantification of emotional states is an important step to understanding
wellbeing. Time series data from multiple modalities such as physiological and
motion sensor data have proven to be integral for measuring and quantifying
emotions. Monitoring emotional trajectories over long periods of time inherits
some critical limitations in relation to the size of the training data. This
shortcoming may hinder the development of reliable and accurate machine
learning models. To address this problem, this paper proposes a framework to
tackle the limitation in performing emotional state recognition on multiple
multimodal datasets: 1) encoding multivariate time series data into coloured
images; 2) leveraging pre-trained object recognition models to apply a Transfer
Learning (TL) approach using the images from step 1; 3) utilising a 1D
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to perform emotion classification from
physiological data; 4) concatenating the pre-trained TL model with the 1D CNN.
Furthermore, the possibility of performing TL to infer stress from
physiological data is explored by initially training a 1D CNN using a large
physical activity dataset and then applying the learned knowledge to the target
dataset. We demonstrate that model performance when inferring real-world
wellbeing rated on a 5-point Likert scale can be enhanced using our framework,
resulting in up to 98.5% accuracy, outperforming a conventional CNN by 4.5%.
Subject-independent models using the same approach resulted in an average of

alternative stable states, is touted as a useful early warning signal of
irreversible transitions to undesirable ecological regimes. However, while
flickering may presage an ecological tipping point, these dynamics also pose
unique challenges for human adaptation. In this work, we link an ecological

variability. The implications of flickering on nomadic communities in Mongolia,
artisanal fisheries, and wildfire systems are explored as possible case
studies. Flickering, driven in part by climate change and changes to governance

livelihoods and wellbeing of people living in those landscapes. Recent years
have seen a rapid increase in the development of EO data applications targeted
at stakeholders in African agricultural systems. But there is still relatively
little critical scholarship questioning how EO data are accessed, presented,
disseminated and used in different socio-political contexts, or of whether this
increases or decreases the wellbeing of poorer and marginalized peoples. We
highlight three neglected areas in existing EO-for-development research: (i)
the imaginaries of 'ideal' future landscapes informing deployments of EO data;
(ii) how power relationships in larger EO-for-development networks shape the
distribution of costs and benefits; and (iii) how these larger-scale political
dynamics interact with local-scale inequalities to influence the resilience of
marginalised peoples. We then propose a framework for critical
EO-for-development research drawing on recent thinking in critical data

does not develop as expected. This often affects vocabulary skills, i.e.,
finding the words to express wants, needs and ideas, which can influence
behaviours linked to wellbeing and daily functioning, such as concentration,
independence, social interactions and managing emotions. Without specialist
support, needs can increase in severity and continue to adulthood.
  The type of support, known as interventions, showing strongest evidence for
improving vocabulary with some signs of improved behaviour and wellbeing are
ones that use word webs. These are diagrams consisting of lines that connect
sound and meaning information about a word to strengthen the child's word
knowledge and use. The diagrams resemble what is commonly known as mind-maps

school educators to help children with language difficulties. In addition,
interventions delivered through mobile-devices has led in some cases to
increased vocabulary gains with positive influence on wellbeing and academic
attainment.
  With advances in technology and availability of user-friendly mobile devices
to capture, combine and replay multimedia, new opportunities for designing
bespoke vocabulary instruction have emerged that are without timing and
location constraints. This brings the potential to engage and motivate users

  Effects via Causal Inference","['F. Swen Kuh', 'Grace S. Chiu', 'Anton H. Westveld']","This research develops a socioeconomic health index for nations through a
model-based approach which incorporates spatial dependence and examines the
impact of a policy through a causal modeling framework. As the gross domestic
product (GDP) has been regarded as a dated measure and tool for benchmarking a
nation's economic performance, there has been a growing consensus for an
alternative measure---such as a composite `wellbeing' index---to holistically
capture a country's socioeconomic health performance. Many conventional ways of
constructing wellbeing/health indices involve combining different observable
metrics, such as life expectancy and education level, to form an index.
However, health is inherently latent with metrics actually being observable
indicators of health. In contrast to the GDP or other conventional health
indices, our approach provides a holistic quantification of the overall
`health' of a nation. We build upon the latent health factor index (LHFI)
approach that has been used to assess the unobservable ecological/ecosystem
health. This framework integratively models the relationship between metrics,
the latent health, and the covariates that drive the notion of health. In this
paper, the LHFI structure is integrated with spatial modeling and statistical
causal modeling, so as to evaluate the impact of a policy variable (mandatory
maternity leave days) on a nation's socioeconomic health, while formally
accounting for spatial dependency among the nations. We apply our model to
countries around the world using data on various metrics and potential
covariates pertaining to different aspects of societal health. The approach is

Markov chain Monte Carlo techniques.",2019,http://arxiv.org/abs/1911.00512v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1911.00512v1

wellbeing,An Axiomatic Theory of Provably-Fair Welfare-Centric Machine Learning,['Cyrus Cousins'],"We address an inherent difficulty in welfare-theoretic fair machine learning
by proposing an equivalently axiomatically-justified alternative and studying
the resulting computational and statistical learning questions. Welfare metrics
quantify overall wellbeing across a population of one or more groups, and
welfare-based objectives and constraints have recently been proposed to
incentivize fair machine learning methods to produce satisfactory solutions
that consider the diverse needs of multiple groups. Unfortunately, many
machine-learning problems are more naturally cast as loss minimization tasks,
rather than utility maximization, which complicates direct application of
welfare-centric methods to fair machine learning. In this work, we define a
complementary measure, termed malfare, measuring overall societal harm (rather
than wellbeing), with axiomatic justification via the standard axioms of
cardinal welfare. We then cast fair machine learning as malfare minimization
over the risk values (expected losses) of each group. Surprisingly, the axioms
of cardinal welfare (malfare) dictate that this is not equivalent to simply
defining utility as negative loss. Building upon these concepts, we define
fair-PAC (FPAC) learning, where an FPAC learner is an algorithm that learns an
$\varepsilon$-$\delta$ malfare-optimal model with bounded sample complexity,
for any data distribution, and for any (axiomatically justified) malfare
concept. Finally, we show broad conditions under which, with appropriate
modifications, standard PAC-learners may be converted to FPAC learners. This
places FPAC learning on firm theoretical ground, as it yields statistical and
computational efficiency guarantees for many well-studied machine-learning
models, and is also practically relevant, as it democratizes fair ML by
providing concrete training algorithms and rigorous generalization guarantees

wellbeing before and after the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. A statistical
challenge in well-being survey studies lies in that outcome variables are often
recorded in different scales, be it continuous, binary, or ordinal. The
presence of mixed data complicates the assessment of the associations between
them while adjusting for covariates. In our study, of particular interest are
the associations between college students' wellbeing and other mental health
measures and how other risk factors moderate these associations during the
pandemic. To this end, we propose a unifying framework for studying partial
association between mixed data. This is achieved by defining a unified residual
using the surrogate method. The idea is to map the residual randomness to the
same continuous scale, regardless of the original scales of outcome variables.
It applies to virtually all commonly used models for covariate adjustments. We
demonstrate the validity of using such defined residuals to assess partial
association. In particular, we develop a measure that generalizes classical
Kendall's tau in the sense that it can size both partial and marginal
associations. More importantly, our development advances the theory of the
surrogate method developed in recent years by showing that it can be used
without requiring outcome variables having a latent variable structure. The use
of our method in the well-being survey analysis reveals (i) significant
moderation effects (i.e., the difference between partial and marginal
associations) of some key risk factors; and (ii) an elevated moderation effect
of physical health, loneliness, and accommodation after the onset of COVID-19.",2023,http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.05362v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.05362v1

elderly. We use wireless body sensors and smart phones to monitor the wellbeing
of the elderly. It can offer remote monitoring for the elderly anytime anywhere

alert pre-assigned people who could be the old people's family and friends, and
call the ambulance of the emergency centre. It also acts as the personal health
information system and the medical guidance which offers one communication
platform and the medical knowledge database so that the family and friends of
the served people can cooperate with doctors to take care of him/her. The
system also features some unique functions that cater to the living demands of
the elderly, including regular reminder, quick alarm, medical guidance, etc.
iCare is not only a real-time health monitoring system for the elderly, but
also a living assistant which can make their lives more convenient and

individual wellbeing and economic conditions and the extent to which the latter
matters (Easterlin, 1995; Stevenson and Wolfers 2008; Tella and MacCulloch

happiness level for the United States on a year by year basis; and regress this

fascinatingly reach social dynamics that explains why this costly behavior has
evolved and persevered. Comparisons with adaptive punishment, however, uncover
an Achilles heel of adaptive rewarding that is due to over-aggression, which in

quantile regression methods for continuous variables and some forms of discrete

neighbor and focus external investments exclusively into the related group. We
show that this very simple alteration of the dynamical rule results in a
surprisingly positive evolutionary outcome -- cooperators prevail even in harsh

microscopic mechanism behind the reported success of the cooperator strategy
can be explained by a blocking mechanism which affects the propagations of

  Significantly","['Hsuan-Wei Lee', 'Colin Cleveland', 'Attila Szolnoki']","A cooperative player invests effort into a common venture without knowing the
partner's intention in advance. But this strategy can be implemented in various
ways when a player is involved in different games simultaneously.
Interestingly, if cooperative players distinguish their neighbors and allocate
all their external investments into the most successful partner's game
exclusively then a significant cooperation level can be reached even at harsh
circumstances where game parameters would dictate full defection otherwise.
This positive impact, however, can also be reached when just a smaller fraction
of players apply this sophisticated investment protocol during the game. To
confirm this hypothesis we have checked several distributions that determine
the fraction of supporting players who apply the mentioned selective investment
protocol. Notably, when these players are not isolated, but their influences
percolate then the whole population may enjoy the benefit of full cooperation
already at a relatively low value of the synergy factor which represents the

substantial attention from several academic research fields in the last years.
There are many applications of WSNs, including environmental monitoring,
industrial automation, intelligent transportation systems, healthcare and

the PhD and at the Master levels. However, these existing courses focus on
particular aspects of WSNs (Networking, or Signal Processing, or Embedded
Software), whereas WSNs encompass disciplines traditionally separated in
Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences. This paper gives two original
contributions: the essential knowledge that should be brought in a WSNs course
is characterized, and a course structure with an harmonious holistic approach
is proposed. A method based on both theory and experiments is illustrated for
the design of this course, whereby the students have hands-on to implement,
understand, and develop in practice the implications of theoretical concepts.
Theory and applications are thus considered all together. Ultimately, the
objective of this paper is to design a new course, to use innovative hands-on
experiments to illustrate the theoretical concepts in the course, to show that
theoretical aspects are essential for the solution of real-life engineering
WSNs problems, and finally to create a fun and interesting teaching and

linearity of the scaling of several health-related quantities, such as the
incidence and mortality of diseases, external causes of death, wellbeing, and
health-care availability, in respect to the population size of cities in
Brazil, Sweden and the USA. We find that deaths by non-communicable diseases
tend to be relatively less common in larger cities, whereas the per-capita
incidence of infectious diseases is relatively larger for increasing population
size. Healthier life style and availability of medical support are
disproportionally higher in larger cities. The results are connected with the
optimization of human and physical resources, and with the non-linear effects

the Quantified Self movement, where individuals log everything ranging from the
number of steps they have taken, to their heart rate, to their sleeping

environment of the users, such as general life style attributes or information
about their social network. This means that the users themselves, and the
medical practitioners, privy to the wearable sensor data, only have a narrow

  In this paper we describe a number of use cases for how social media can be
used to complement the check-up data and those from sensors to gain a more
holistic view on individuals' health, a perspective we call the 360 Quantified

  In this paper we explore the use of deep learning to build sleep quality
prediction models based on actigraphy data. We first use deep learning as a
pure model building device by performing human activity recognition (HAR) on
raw sensor data, and using deep learning to build sleep prediction models. We
compare the deep learning models with those build using classical approaches,

Secondly, we employ the advantage of deep learning with its ability to handle
high dimensional datasets. We explore several deep learning models on the raw
wearable sensor output without performing HAR or any other feature extraction.
  Our results show that using a convolutional neural network on the raw
wearables output improves the predictive value of sleep quality from physical

  learning","['Orianna DeMasi', 'Konrad Kording', 'Benjamin Recht']","A new trend in medicine is the use of algorithms to analyze big datasets,
e.g. using everything your phone measures about you for diagnostics or
monitoring. However, these algorithms are commonly compared against weak
baselines, which may contribute to excessive optimism. To assess how well an
algorithm works, scientists typically ask how well its output correlates with
medically assigned scores. Here we perform a meta-analysis to quantify how the
literature evaluates their algorithms for monitoring mental wellbeing. We find
that the bulk of the literature ($\sim$77%) uses meaningless comparisons that
ignore patient baseline state. For example, having an algorithm that uses phone
data to diagnose mood disorders would be useful. However, it is possible to
over 80% of the variance of some mood measures in the population by simply
guessing that each patient has their own average mood - the patient-specific
baseline. Thus, an algorithm that just predicts that our mood is like it
usually is can explain the majority of variance, but is, obviously, entirely
useless. Comparing to the wrong (population) baseline has a massive effect on
the perceived quality of algorithms and produces baseless optimism in the

reduced social interaction due to hearing impairment affects creating or
maintaining healthy relationships at home, school and work [5]. Hence, hearing
impairment genuinely affects the overall quality of life and wellbeing.
  The cocktail party effect, which is a healthy hearing individual's ability to
understand one voice in a cacophony of other voices or sounds, is an important
ability lacking in people with hearing impairment. This inability results in
difficulties with simple daily activities such as partaking in group
discussions or conversing in noisy restaurants [6]. This smart hearing aid aims
to provide much-needed assistance with understanding speech in noisy
environments. For example, if a person wants to partake in a group discussion,
he/she needs to place the microphone array based unit on a flat surface in
front of him/her, such as a table. When conversations take place, the
microphone array will capture and process sound from all directions,
intelligently prioritise and provide the lead speaker's voice by suppressing
unwanted noises, including speeches of other people. This device selects and
alternates voices between speakers automatically using voice algorithms.
Additionally, the user has the option of further fine-tuning the acoustic

namely walking, cycling and bikesharing, in a joint modeling framework. The
analysis is based on an adaptation of the stages of change framework, which
originates from the health behavior sciences. Multivariate ordered probit
modeling drawing on U.S. survey data provides well-needed insights into
individuals preparedness to adopt multiple active modes as a function of
personal, neighborhood and psychosocial factors. The research suggests three
important findings. 1) The joint model structure confirms interdependence among
different active mobility choices. The strongest complementarity is found for
walking and cycling adoption. 2) Each mode has a distinctive adoption path with
either three or four separate stages. We discuss the implications of derived
stage-thresholds and plot adoption contours for selected scenarios. 3)
Psychological and neighborhood variables generate more coupling among active
modes than individual and household factors. Specifically, identifying strongly
with active mobility aspirations, experiences with multimodal travel,
possessing better navigational skills, along with supportive local community
norms are the factors that appear to drive the joint adoption decisions. This

wellbeing,"Assistive robots for the social management of health: a framework for
  robot design and human-robot interaction research","['Meia Chita-Tegmark', 'Matthias Scheutz']","There is a close connection between health and the quality of one's social
life. Strong social bonds are essential for health and wellbeing, but often
health conditions can detrimentally affect a person's ability to interact with
others. This can become a vicious cycle resulting in further decline in health.
For this reason, the social management of health is an important aspect of
healthcare. We propose that socially assistive robots (SARs) could help people
with health conditions maintain positive social lives by supporting them in
social interactions. This paper makes three contributions, as detailed below.
We develop a framework of social mediation functions that robots could perform,
motivated by the special social needs that people with health conditions have.
In this framework we identify five types of functions that SARs could perform:
a) changing how the person is perceived, b) enhancing the social behavior of
the person, c) modifying the social behavior of others, d) providing structure
for interactions, and e) changing how the person feels. We thematically
organize and review the existing literature on robots supporting human-human
interactions, in both clinical and non-clinical settings, and explain how the
findings and design ideas from these studies can be applied to the functions
identified in the framework. Finally, we point out and discuss challenges in
designing SARs for supporting social interactions, and highlight opportunities
for future robot design and HRI research on the mediator role of robots.",2020,http://arxiv.org/abs/2002.03062v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2002.03062v2

  dilemma","['Zhilong Xiao', 'Xiaojie Chen', 'Attila Szolnoki']","Individual migration has been regarded as an important factor for the
evolution of cooperation in mobile populations. Motivations of migration,
however, can be largely divergent: one is highly frustrated by the vicinity of
an exploiter or defector, while other enthusiastically searches cooperator
mates. Albeit both extreme attitudes are observed in human behavior, but their
specific impacts on wellbeing remained unexplored. In this work, we propose an
orientation-driven migration approach for mobile individuals in combination
with the mentioned migration preferences and study their roles in the
cooperation level in a two-dimensional public goods game. We find that
cooperation can be greatly promoted when individuals are more inclined to
escape away from their defective neighbors. On the contrary, cooperation cannot
be effectively maintained when individuals are more motivated to approach their
cooperative neighbors. In addition, compared with random migration, movement by
leaving defectors can promote cooperation more effectively. By means of
theoretical analysis and numerical calculations, we further find that when
individuals only choose to escape away from their defective neighbors, the
average distance between cooperators and defectors can be enlarged, hence the
natural invasion of defection can be efficiently blocked. Our work, thus,
provides further insight on how different migration preferences influence the

  Embedded Speech and Audio Processing from Decentralised Data","['Shahin Amiriparian', 'Tobias Hübner', 'Maurice Gerczuk', 'Sandra Ottl', 'Björn W. Schuller']","Deep neural speech and audio processing systems have a large number of
trainable parameters, a relatively complex architecture, and require a vast
amount of training data and computational power. These constraints make it more
challenging to integrate such systems into embedded devices and utilise them
for real-time, real-world applications. We tackle these limitations by
introducing DeepSpectrumLite, an open-source, lightweight transfer learning
framework for on-device speech and audio recognition using pre-trained image
convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The framework creates and augments
Mel-spectrogram plots on-the-fly from raw audio signals which are then used to
finetune specific pre-trained CNNs for the target classification task.
Subsequently, the whole pipeline can be run in real-time with a mean inference
lag of 242.0 ms when a DenseNet121 model is used on a consumer-grade Motorola
moto e7 plus smartphone. DeepSpectrumLite operates decentralised, eliminating
the need for data upload for further processing. By obtaining state-of-the-art
results on a set of paralinguistics tasks, we demonstrate the suitability of
the proposed transfer learning approach for embedded audio signal processing,
even when data is scarce. We provide an extensive command-line interface for

health. People with insufficient sleep are more likely to report physical and
mental distress, activity limitation, anxiety, and pain. Moreover, in the past
few years, there has been an explosion of applications and devices for activity
monitoring and health tracking. Signals collected from these wearable devices
can be used to study and improve sleep quality. In this paper, we utilize the
relationship between physical activity and sleep quality to find ways of
assisting people improve their sleep using machine learning techniques. People
usually have several behavior modes that their bio-functions can be divided
into. Performing time series clustering on activity data, we find cluster
centers that would correlate to the most evident behavior modes for a specific
subject. Activity recipes are then generated for good sleep quality for each
behavior mode within each cluster. These activity recipes are supplied to an
activity recommendation engine for suggesting a mix of relaxed to intense
activities to subjects during their daily routines. The recommendations are
further personalized based on the subjects' lifestyle constraints, i.e. their
age, gender, body mass index (BMI), resting heart rate, etc, with the objective
of the recommendation being the improvement of that night's quality of sleep.
This would in turn serve a longer-term health objective, like lowering heart

under driving condition have become a major concern. Such issues may vary from
fatigue, asthma, stroke, to even heart attack, yet they can be adequately
indicated by vital signs and abnormal activities. Therefore, in-vehicle vital
sign monitoring can help us predict and hence prevent these issues. Whereas
existing sensor-based (including camera) methods could be used to detect these

intelligent system performing monitoring tasks using a COTS impulse radio

vital signs under driving condition and with the presence of passengers, thus
allowing for potentially inferring corresponding health issues. Compared with
prior work based on Wi-Fi CSI, V2iFi is able to distinguish reflected signals
from multiple users, and hence provide finer-grained measurements under more
realistic settings. We evaluate V2iFi both in lab environments and during
real-life road tests; the results demonstrate that respiratory rate, heart

these estimation results, we further discuss how machine learning models can be
applied on top of V2iFi so as to improve both physiological and psychological

wellbeing,Multi-system intervention optimization for interdependent infrastructure,"['Omar Kammouh', 'Maria Nogal', 'Ruud Binnekamp', 'Rogier Wolfert']","The wellbeing of modern societies is dependent upon the functioning of their
infrastructure networks. This paper introduces the 3C concept, an integrative
multi-system and multi-stakeholder optimization approach for managing
infrastructure interventions (e.g., maintenance, renovation, etc.). The
proposed approach takes advantage of the benefits achieved by grouping (i.e.,
optimizing) intervention activities. Intervention optimization leads to
substantial savings on both direct intervention costs (operator) and indirect
unavailability costs (society) by reducing the number of system interruptions.
The proposed optimization approach is formalized into a structured mathematical
model that can account for the interactions between multiple infrastructure
networks and the impact on multiple stakeholders (e.g., society and
infrastructure operators), and it can accommodate different types of
intervention, such as maintenance, removal, and upgrading. The different types
of interdependencies, within and across infrastructures, are modeled using a
proposed interaction matrix (IM). The IM allows integrating the interventions
of different infrastructure networks whose interventions are normally planned
independently. Moreover, the introduced 3C concept accounts for central
interventions, which are those that must occur at a pre-established time
moment, where neither delay nor advance is permitted. To demonstrate the
applicability of the proposed approach, an illustrative example of a
multi-system and multi-actor intervention planning is introduced. Results show
a substantial reduction in the operator and societal costs. In addition, the
optimal intervention program obtained in the analysis shows no predictable
patterns, which indicates it is a useful managerial decision support tool.",2022,http://arxiv.org/abs/2203.01411v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.01411v1

approach to explore current and future uses of narrow AI and automated decision

implications for equity. Accounts reveal a tremendous expectation on AI to
transform medical and public health practices. Prominent demonstrations of AI
capability - particularly in diagnostic decision making, risk prediction, and

domains such as criminal justice where narrow AI and ADS are in common use.
Reports of issues arising from their use in health are already appearing. As
the use of ADS in health expands, it is probable that these hazards will
manifest more widely. Bias, incontestability, and privacy erosion give rise to
mechanisms by which existing social, economic and health disparities are
perpetuated and amplified. Consequently, there is a significant risk that use
of ADS in health will exacerbate existing population health inequities. The

'ethics' currently deployed (Wagner 2018) in determining whether AI is 'good'

restricted our search to eight databases, namely PubMed, WorldCat, MEDLINE,
ProQuest, ScienceDirect, SpringerLink, Wiley, and ERIC, to analyze research
articles published in English between January 2010 and June 2019. We focused on
studies that used ML algorithms in the care of geriatrics patients with chronic

groups-psychological disorder (n=22), eye diseases (n=6), and others (n=7).
This review identified the lack of standardized ML evaluation metrics and the

studies and ML standardization tailored to health care applications are
required to confirm whether ML could aid in improving geriatric clinical care.",2021,http://arxiv.org/abs/2111.08441v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.08441v1

wellbeing,"Fairness-Aware Naive Bayes Classifier for Data with Multiple Sensitive
  Features",['Stelios Boulitsakis-Logothetis'],"Fairness-aware machine learning seeks to maximise utility in generating
predictions while avoiding unfair discrimination based on sensitive attributes
such as race, sex, religion, etc. An important line of work in this field is
enforcing fairness during the training step of a classifier. A simple yet
effective binary classification algorithm that follows this strategy is
two-naive-Bayes (2NB), which enforces statistical parity - requiring that the
groups comprising the dataset receive positive labels with the same likelihood.
In this paper, we generalise this algorithm into N-naive-Bayes (NNB) to
eliminate the simplification of assuming only two sensitive groups in the data
and instead apply it to an arbitrary number of groups.
  We propose an extension of the original algorithm's statistical parity
constraint and the post-processing routine that enforces statistical
independence of the label and the single sensitive attribute. Then, we
investigate its application on data with multiple sensitive features and
propose a new constraint and post-processing routine to enforce differential
fairness, an extension of established group-fairness constraints focused on
intersectionalities. We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of the NNB
algorithm on US Census datasets and compare its accuracy and debiasing
performance, as measured by disparate impact and DF-$\epsilon$ score, with
similar group-fairness algorithms. Finally, we lay out important considerations
users should be aware of before incorporating this algorithm into their
application, and direct them to further reading on the pros, cons, and ethical
implications of using statistical parity as a fairness criterion.",2022,http://arxiv.org/abs/2202.11499v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2202.11499v1

wellbeing,"Embedded Multilevel Regression and Poststratification: Model-based
  Inference with Incomplete Auxiliary Information","['Katherine Li', 'Yajuan Si']","Health disparity research often evaluates health outcomes across demographic
subgroups. Multilevel regression and poststratification (MRP) is a popular
approach for small subgroup estimation due to its ability to stabilize
estimates by fitting multilevel models and to adjust for selection bias by
poststratifying on auxiliary variables, which are population characteristics
predictive of the analytic outcome. However, the granularity and quality of the
estimates produced by MRP are limited by the availability of the auxiliary
variables' joint distribution; data analysts often only have access to the
marginal distributions. To overcome this limitation, we embed the estimation of
population cell counts needed for poststratification into the MRP workflow:
embedded MRP (EMRP). Under EMRP, we generate synthetic populations of the
auxiliary variables before implementing MRP. All sources of estimation
uncertainty are propagated with a fully Bayesian framework. Through simulation
studies, we compare different methods and demonstrate EMRP's improvements over
alternatives on the bias-variance tradeoff to yield valid subpopulation
inferences of interest. As an illustration, we apply EMRP to the Longitudinal
Survey of Wellbeing and estimate food insecurity prevalence among vulnerable
groups in New York City. We find that all EMRP estimators can correct for the
bias in classical MRP while maintaining lower standard errors and narrower
confidence intervals than directly imputing with the WFPBB and design-based
estimates. Performances from the EMRP estimators do not differ substantially
from each other, though we would generally recommend the WFPBB-MRP for its
consistently high coverage rates.",2022,http://arxiv.org/abs/2205.02775v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.02775v3

  Reference Data","['Johannes N. Hansen', 'Edward T. A. Mitchard', 'Stuart King']","Forests are vital for the wellbeing of our planet. Large and small scale
deforestation across the globe is threatening the stability of our climate,
forest biodiversity, and therefore the preservation of fragile ecosystems and
our natural habitat as a whole. With increasing public interest in climate
change issues and forest preservation, a large demand for carbon offsetting,
carbon footprint ratings, and environmental impact assessments is emerging.
Most often, deforestation maps are created from optical data such as Landsat
and MODIS. These maps are not typically available at less than annual intervals
due to persistent cloud cover in many parts of the world, especially the
tropics where most of the world's forest biomass is concentrated. Synthetic
Aperture Radar (SAR) can fill this gap as it penetrates clouds. We propose and
evaluate a novel method for deforestation detection in the absence of reliable
reference data which often constitutes the largest practical hurdle. This
method achieves a change detection sensitivity (producer's accuracy) of 96.5%
in the study area, although false positives lead to a lower user's accuracy of
about 75.7%, with a total balanced accuracy of 90.4%. The change detection
accuracy is maintained when adding up to 20% noise to the reference labels.
While further work is required to reduce the false positive rate, improve
detection delay, and validate this method in additional circumstances, the
results show that Sentinel-1 data have the potential to advance the timeliness

social wellbeing because of the reduced human activity due to extreme events.
Community resilience is an important and widely used concept to understand the
impacts of an extreme event to population activity. Resilience is generally
defined as the ability of a system to manage shocks and return to a steady
state in response to an extreme event. In this study, aggregate location data
from Facebook in response to Hurricane Ida are analyzed. Using changes in the
number of Facebook users before, during, and after the disaster, community
resilience is quantified as a function of the magnitude of impact and the time
to recover from the extreme situation. Based on the resilience function, the
transient loss of resilience in population activity is measured for the
affected communities in Louisiana. The loss in resilience of the affected
communities are explained by three types of factors, including disruption in
physical infrastructures, disaster conditions due to hurricanes, and
socio-economic characteristics. A greater loss in community resilience is
associated with factors such as disruptions in power and transportation
services and disaster conditions. Socioeconomic disparities in loss of
resilience are found with respect to median income of a community.
Understanding community resilience using decreased population activity levels

gastrointestinal (GI) disorders. However, the assessment requires a trained

developing wearables for continuous capture of ABS, which enables a fuller
picture of patient's GI status to be obtained at reduced cost. This paper seeks
to evaluate the feasibility of extracting heart rate (HR) from such ABS

we leverage wavelet denoising for improved heart beat detection. The mean
absolute error of the algorithm for average HR is 3.4 BPM with mean directional

  Under Tornado Hazards","['Mehdi Ansari', 'Juan S. Borrero', 'Andres D. Gonzalez']","Catastrophic tornadoes cause severe damage and are a threat to human
wellbeing, making it critical to determine mitigation strategies to reduce
their impact. One such strategy, following recent research, is to retrofit
existing structures. To this end, in this article we propose a model that
considers a decision-maker (a government agency or a public-private consortium)
who seeks to allocate resources to retrofit and recover wood-frame residential
structures, to minimize the population dislocation due to an uncertain tornado.
In the first stage the decision-maker selects the retrofitting strategies, and
in the second stage the recovery decisions are made after observing the
tornado. As tornado paths cannot be forecast reliably, we take a worst-case
approach to uncertainty where paths are modeled as arbitrary line segments on
the plane. Under the assumption that an area is affected if it is sufficiently
close to the tornado path, the problem is framed as a two-stage robust
optimization problem with a mixed-integer non-linear uncertainty set. We solve
this problem by using a decomposition column-and-constraint generation
algorithm that solves a two-level integer problem at each iteration. This
problem, in turn, is solved by a decomposition branch-and-cut method that
exploits the geometry of the uncertainty set. To illustrate the model's
applicability, we present a case study based on Joplin, Missouri. Our results
show that there can be up to 20 percent reductions in worst-case population
dislocation by investing 15 million dollars in retrofitting and recovery; that
our approach outperforms other retrofitting policies, and that the model is not

  This paper presents the Consequence-Mechanism-Risk framework to identify

drawn on wide-ranging literature detailing risks to workers, and categorised
risks as being to worker value, power, and wellbeing. The contribution of our

power, and marginalisation, and (ii) the mechanisms, which represent how these
consequences may take effect in the system. The mechanisms are a means of
contextualising risk within specific system processes, which is critical for
mitigation. This framework is aimed at helping practitioners involved in the

introduce those risks and begin to approach mitigation. Future work could apply

intra-variability where clinical diagnosis only has a 30\% positive predictive
value when classifying pathological outcomes. Machine learning models, trained
with FIGO and other user derived features extracted from CTG traces, have been
shown to increase positive predictive capacity and minimise variability. This
is only possible however when class distributions are equal which is rarely the
case in clinical trials where case-control observations are heavily skewed in
favour of normal outcomes. Classes can be balanced using either synthetic data
derived from resampled case training data or by decreasing the number of
control instances. However, this either introduces bias or removes valuable

interesting results, deriving an optimal set of features is considered to be an
art as well as a science and is often an empirical and time consuming process.
In this paper, we address both of these issues and propose a novel CTG analysis

rural areas are not left behind in terms of development and policy
considerations is a priority for governments worldwide. However, it is
increasingly challenging to track important statistics concerning this sparse,
geographically dispersed population, resulting in a lack of reliable,
up-to-date data. In this study, we examine the usefulness of the Facebook
Advertising platform, which offers a digital ""census"" of over two billions of
its users, in measuring potential rural-urban inequalities. We focus on Italy,
a country where about 30% of the population lives in rural areas. First, we
show that the population statistics that Facebook produces suffer from
instability across time and incomplete coverage of sparsely populated
municipalities. To overcome such limitation, we propose an alternative
methodology for estimating Facebook Ads audiences that nearly triples the
coverage of the rural municipalities from 19% to 55% and makes feasible
fine-grained sub-population analysis. Using official national census data, we
evaluate our approach and confirm known significant urban-rural divides in
terms of educational attainment and income. Extending the analysis to
Facebook-specific user ""interests"" and behaviors, we provide further insights
on the divide, for instance, finding that rural areas show a higher interest in
gambling. Notably, we find that the most predictive features of income in rural
areas differ from those for urban centres, suggesting researchers need to
consider a broader range of attributes when examining rural wellbeing. The
findings of this study illustrate the necessity of improving existing tools and
methodologies to include under-represented populations in digital demographic
studies -- the failure to do so could result in misleading observations,

justice, but only when it has the right analog complements (such as
well-thought out policies, mature institutions, responsible governance); and
the ultimate objective of these smart cities is to facilitate and enhance human
welfare and social flourishing. Researchers have shown that various
technological business models and features can in fact contribute to social
problems such as extremism, polarization, misinformation, and Internet

  and economy in a simple World-Earth model","['Jan Nitzbon', 'Jobst Heitzig', 'Ulrich Parlitz']","The Anthropocene is characterized by close interdependencies between the
natural Earth system and the human society, posing novel challenges to model
development. Here we present a conceptual model describing the long-term
coevolution of natural and socioeconomic subsystems of Earth. While the climate
is represented via a global carbon cycle, we use economic concepts to model
socio-metabolic flows of biomass and fossil fuels between nature and society. A
wellbeing-dependent parametrization of fertility and mortality governs human
population dynamics. Our analysis focuses on assessing possible asymptotic
states of the Earth system for a qualitative understanding of its complex
dynamics rather than quantitative predictions. Low dimension and simple
equations enable a parameter-space analysis allowing us to identify
preconditions of several asymptotic states and hence fates of humanity and
planet. These include a sustainable co-evolution of nature and society, a
global collapse and everlasting oscillations. We consider scenarios
corresponding to different socio-cultural stages of human history. The
necessity of accounting for the ""human factor"" in Earth system models is
highlighted by the fact that carbon stocks during the past centuries evolved
opposing to what would ""naturally"" be expected on a planet without humans. The
intensity of biomass use and the contribution of ecosystem services to human
well-being are found to be crucial determinants of the asymptotic state in a
biomass-only scenario. The capitalistic, fossil-based scenario reveals that
trajectories with fundamentally different asymptotic states might still be
almost indistinguishable during a very long transient phase. Given current
population levels, our study also supports the claim that besides reducing the

used to study complex, temporal interactions between the participants
self-reported personality traits, weekly baseline wellbeing scores, session

study. DBN modelling involves learning a graphical representation that
facilitates intuitive understanding of how multiple components contribute to
the longitudinal changes in session ratings corresponding to the perceptions of
the RC, and participants relaxation and calm levels. The learnt model captures
the following within and between sessions aspects of the longitudinal
interaction study: influence of the 5 personality dimensions on the facial AU
states and the session ratings, influence of facial AU states on the session
ratings, and the influences within the items of the session ratings. The DBN
structure is learnt using first 3 time points and the obtained model is used to
predict the session ratings of the last 2 time points of the 5-week

R2 scores. We also demonstrate two applications of the model, namely,
imputation of missing values in the dataset and estimation of longitudinal

support international migrants who need to survive a crisis in their host
countries. The current paper presents an interview study with two cohorts of
Chinese migrants living in Japan (N=14) and the United States (N=14).
Participants reflected on their information seeking experiences during the
COVID pandemic. The reflection was supplemented by two weeks of self-tracking

practice. Our data indicated that participants often took language detours, or
visits to Mandarin resources for information about the COVID outbreak in their

perform selective reading, cross-checking, and contextualized interpretation of
COVID-related information in Japanese or English. While such practices enhanced
participants' perceived effectiveness of COVID-related information gathering

Further, participants lacked the awareness or preference to review
migrant-oriented information that was issued by the host country's public
authorities despite its availability. Building upon these findings, we

requirements sustained over three main pillars that should be met throughout
the system's entire life cycle: it should be (1) lawful, (2) ethical, and (3)
robust, both from a technical and a social perspective. However, attaining
truly trustworthy AI concerns a wider vision that comprises the trustworthiness
of all processes and actors that are part of the system's life cycle, and
considers previous aspects from different lenses. A more holistic vision
contemplates four essential axes: the global principles for ethical use and
development of AI-based systems, a philosophical take on AI ethics, a
risk-based approach to AI regulation, and the mentioned pillars and
requirements. The seven requirements (human agency and oversight; robustness
and safety; privacy and data governance; transparency; diversity,
non-discrimination and fairness; societal and environmental wellbeing; and
accountability) are analyzed from a triple perspective: What each requirement
for trustworthy AI is, Why it is needed, and How each requirement can be
implemented in practice. On the other hand, a practical approach to implement
trustworthy AI systems allows defining the concept of responsibility of
AI-based systems facing the law, through a given auditing process. Therefore, a
responsible AI system is the resulting notion we introduce in this work, and a
concept of utmost necessity that can be realized through auditing processes,
subject to the challenges posed by the use of regulatory sandboxes. Our
multidisciplinary vision of trustworthy AI culminates in a debate on the

Social Frames that allow the adaptation of an agent's cognition based on its

commenters, the length and sentiments of comments). Our findings show that: 1)
users were more likely to share their age, education, and location information
when seeking both informational and emotional support, as opposed to pursuing
either one; 2) while personal information sharing was positively correlated
with receiving informational support when requested, it did not correlate with
emotional support; 3) as the degree of self-disclosure increased, information
support seekers obtained higher submission scores and longer comments, whereas
emotional support seekers' self-disclosure resulted in lower submission scores,
fewer comments, and fewer unique commenters; 4) post characteristics affecting
social feedback differed significantly based on types of support sought by post
authors. These results provide empirical evidence for the varying effects of
self-disclosure on acquiring desired support and user involvement online during

social support,Social World Knowledge: Modeling and Applications,"['Nir Lotan', 'Einat Minkov']","Social world knowledge is a key ingredient in effective communication and
information processing by humans and machines alike. As of today, there exist
many knowledge bases that represent factual world knowledge. Yet, there is no
resource that is designed to capture social aspects of world knowledge. We
believe that this work makes an important step towards the formulation and
construction of such a resource. We introduce SocialVec, a general framework
for eliciting low-dimensional entity embeddings from the social contexts in
which they occur in social networks. In this framework, entities correspond to
highly popular accounts which invoke general interest. We assume that entities
that individual users tend to co-follow are socially related, and use this
definition of social context to learn the entity embeddings. Similar to word
embeddings which facilitate tasks that involve text semantics, we expect the
learned social entity embeddings to benefit multiple tasks of social flavor. In
this work, we elicited the social embeddings of roughly 200K entities from a
sample of 1.3M Twitter users and the accounts that they follow. We employ and
gauge the resulting embeddings on two tasks of social importance. First, we
assess the political bias of news sources in terms of entity similarity in the
social embedding space. Second, we predict the personal traits of individual
Twitter users based on the social embeddings of entities that they follow. In
both cases, we show advantageous or competitive performance using our approach
compared with task-specific baselines. We further show that existing entity
embedding schemes, which are fact-based, fail to capture social aspects of
knowledge. We make the learned social entity embeddings available to the
research community to support further exploration of social world knowledge and
its applications.",2023,http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.16299v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.16299v1
social support,"Assistive robots for the social management of health: a framework for
  robot design and human-robot interaction research","['Meia Chita-Tegmark', 'Matthias Scheutz']","There is a close connection between health and the quality of one's social
life. Strong social bonds are essential for health and wellbeing, but often
health conditions can detrimentally affect a person's ability to interact with
others. This can become a vicious cycle resulting in further decline in health.
For this reason, the social management of health is an important aspect of
healthcare. We propose that socially assistive robots (SARs) could help people
with health conditions maintain positive social lives by supporting them in
social interactions. This paper makes three contributions, as detailed below.
We develop a framework of social mediation functions that robots could perform,
motivated by the special social needs that people with health conditions have.
In this framework we identify five types of functions that SARs could perform:
a) changing how the person is perceived, b) enhancing the social behavior of
the person, c) modifying the social behavior of others, d) providing structure
for interactions, and e) changing how the person feels. We thematically
organize and review the existing literature on robots supporting human-human
interactions, in both clinical and non-clinical settings, and explain how the
findings and design ideas from these studies can be applied to the functions
identified in the framework. Finally, we point out and discuss challenges in
designing SARs for supporting social interactions, and highlight opportunities
for future robot design and HRI research on the mediator role of robots.",2020,http://arxiv.org/abs/2002.03062v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2002.03062v2

interactions. However, as the complexity of the systems increase, we argue that
novel modeling approaches are needed that can deal with inter-dependencies at
different levels of society, where many heterogeneous parties (software agents,
robots, humans) are interacting and reacting to each other. In this paper, we
present a formalization of a social framework for agents based on the concept
of Social Practices as high level specifications of normal (expected) behavior
in a given social context. We argue that social practices facilitate the
practical reasoning of agents in standard social interactions. Thus they can
support deliberations for complex situations just like conventions and norms.
However, they also come with a social context that gives handles for social
planning and deliberation in top of the normal functional deliberation. The
main goal of this paper is to give a formalization of social practices that can
be used as a basis for implementations and defining precise structures within
which social learning can take place.",2022,http://arxiv.org/abs/2206.06088v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.06088v1

Various lines of empirical evidence have supported the social brain hypothesis,
including evidence from the structure of social networks. Social complexity may
itself positively impact cooperation among individuals, which occurs across
different animal taxa and is a key behavior for successful group living.
Theoretical research has shown that particular structures of social networks
foster cooperation more easily than others. Therefore, we hypothesized that
species with a relatively large neocortex tend to form social networks that
better enable cooperation. In the present study, we combine data on brain and
body mass, data on social networks, and theory on the evolution of cooperation
on networks to test this hypothesis in primates. We have found a positive

  in Cases of Domestic Violence","['Elisa Bellotti', 'Susanne Boethius', 'Malin Akerstrom', 'Margareta Hyden']","Social networks are usually considered as positive sources of social support,
a role which has been extensively studied in the context of domestic violence.
To victims of abuse, social networks often provide initial emotional and
practical help as well useful information ahead of formal institutions.
Recently, however, attention has been paid to the negative responses of social
networks. In this article, we advance the theoretical debate on social networks
as a source of social support by moving beyond the distinction between positive
and negative ties. We do so by proposing the concepts of relational ambivalence
and consistency, which describe the interactive processes by which people,
intentionally or inadvertently, disregard or align with each other role
relational expectations, therefore undermining or reinforcing individual
choices of action. We analyse the qualitative accounts of nineteen female
victims of domestic violence in Sweden, who described the responses of their
personal networks during and after the abuse. We observe how the relationships
embedded in these networks were described in ambivalent and consistent terms,
and how they played a role in supporting or undermining women in reframing
their loving relationships as abusive; in accounting or dismissing perpetrators
responsibilities for the abuse; in relieving women from role expectations and
obligations or in burdening them with further responsibilities; and in
supporting or challenging their pathways out of domestic abuse. Our analysis
suggests that social isolation cannot be considered a simple result of a lack
of support but of the complex dynamics in which support is offered and accepted
or withdrawn and refused.",2021,http://arxiv.org/abs/2111.13104v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.13104v1

about these social structures to successfully navigate social relationships.
Here we address this knowledge gap with an interdisciplinary neuroimaging study
drawing on recent advances in network science and statistical learning.
Specifically, we collected BOLD MRI data while participants learned the
community structure of both social and non-social networks, in order to examine
whether the learning of these two types of networks was differentially
associated with functional brain network topology. From the behavioral data in
both tasks, we found that learners were sensitive to the community structure of
the networks, as evidenced by a slower reaction time on trials transitioning
between clusters than on trials transitioning within a cluster. From the
neuroimaging data collected during the social network learning task, we
observed that the functional connectivity of the hippocampus and
temporoparietal junction was significantly greater when transitioning between
clusters than when transitioning within a cluster. Furthermore, temporoparietal
regions of the default mode were more strongly connected to hippocampus,
somatomotor, and visual regions during the social task than during the

path to other users, they do so in a centralized way, thus requiring them to
rely on the service provider and reveal their interest in each other. This
paper presents Social PaL, a system supporting the privacy-preserving discovery
of arbitrary-length social paths between any two social network users. We
overcome the bootstrapping problem encountered in all related prior work,
demonstrating that Social PaL allows its users to find all paths of length two
and to discover a significant fraction of longer paths, even when only a small
fraction of OSN users is in the Social PaL system - e.g., discovering 70% of
all paths with only 40% of the users. We implement Social PaL using a scalable
server-side architecture and a modular Android client library, allowing
developers to seamlessly integrate it into their apps.",2014,http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.2433v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1412.2433v3
social support,"The co-evolution of emotional well-being with weak and strong friendship
  ties","['Timon Elmer', 'Zsofia Boda', 'Christoph Stadtfeld']","Social ties are strongly related to well-being. But what characterizes this
relationship? This study investigates social mechanisms explaining how social
ties affect well-being through social integration and social influence, and how
well-being affects social ties through social selection. We hypothesize that
highly integrated individuals - those with more extensive and dense friendship
networks - report higher emotional well-being than others. Moreover, emotional
well-being should be influenced by the well-being of close friends. Finally,
well-being should affect friendship selection when individuals prefer others
with higher levels of well-being, and others whose well-being is similar to
theirs. We test our hypotheses using longitudinal social network and well-being
data of 117 individuals living in a graduate housing community. The application
of a novel extension of Stochastic Actor-Oriented Models for ordered networks
(ordered SAOMs) allows us to detail and test our hypotheses for weak- and
strong-tied friendship networks simultaneously. Results do not support our
social integration and social influence hypotheses but provide evidence for
selection: individuals with higher emotional well-being tend to have more
strong-tied friends, and there are homophily processes regarding emotional
well-being in strong-tied networks. Our study highlights the two-directional
relationship between social ties and well-being, and demonstrates the
importance of considering different tie strengths for various social processes.",2017,http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.02935v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1705.02935v1

  Language","['Maarten Sap', 'Saadia Gabriel', 'Lianhui Qin', 'Dan Jurafsky', 'Noah A. Smith', 'Yejin Choi']","Warning: this paper contains content that may be offensive or upsetting.
  Language has the power to reinforce stereotypes and project social biases
onto others. At the core of the challenge is that it is rarely what is stated
explicitly, but rather the implied meanings, that frame people's judgments
about others. For example, given a statement that ""we shouldn't lower our
standards to hire more women,"" most listeners will infer the implicature
intended by the speaker -- that ""women (candidates) are less qualified."" Most
semantic formalisms, to date, do not capture such pragmatic implications in
which people express social biases and power differentials in language.
  We introduce Social Bias Frames, a new conceptual formalism that aims to
model the pragmatic frames in which people project social biases and
stereotypes onto others. In addition, we introduce the Social Bias Inference
Corpus to support large-scale modelling and evaluation with 150k structured
annotations of social media posts, covering over 34k implications about a
thousand demographic groups.
  We then establish baseline approaches that learn to recover Social Bias
Frames from unstructured text. We find that while state-of-the-art neural
models are effective at high-level categorization of whether a given statement
projects unwanted social bias (80% F1), they are not effective at spelling out
more detailed explanations in terms of Social Bias Frames. Our study motivates
future work that combines structured pragmatic inference with commonsense
reasoning on social implications.",2019,http://arxiv.org/abs/1911.03891v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1911.03891v3
social support,"Socially intelligent task and motion planning for human-robot
  interaction","['Andrea Frank', 'Laurel Riek']","As social beings, much human behavior is predicated on social context - the
ambient social state that includes cultural norms, social signals, individual
preferences, etc. In this paper, we propose a socially-aware task and motion
planning algorithm that considers social context to generate appropriate and
effective plans in human social environments (HSEs). The key strength of our
proposed approach is that it explicitly models how potential actions not only
affect objective cost, but also transform the social context in which it plans
and acts. We investigate strategies to limit the complexity of our algorithm,
so that our planner will remain tractable for mobile platforms in complex HSEs
like hospitals and factories. The planner will also consider the relative
importance and urgency of its tasks, which it uses to determine when it is and
is not appropriate to violate social expectations to achieve its objective.
This social awareness will allow robots to understand a fundamental rule of
society: just because something makes your job easier, does not make it the
right thing to do!
  To our knowledge, the proposed work is the first task and motion planning
approach that supports socially intelligent robot policy for HSEs. Through this
ongoing work, robots will be able to understand, respect, and leverage social
context accomplish tasks both acceptably and effectively in HSEs.",2020,http://arxiv.org/abs/2001.08398v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2001.08398v1
social support,The Evolution of Sociality and the Polyvagal Theory,"['J. Sean Doody', 'Gordon Burghardt', 'Vladimir Dinets']","The polyvagal theory (PT), offered by Porges (2021), proposes that the
autonomic nervous system (ANS) was repurposed in mammals, via a second vagal
nerve, to suppress defensive strategies and support the expression of
sociality. Three critical assumptions of this theory are that (1) the
transition of the ANS was associated with the evolution of social mammals from
asocial reptiles; (2) the transition enabled mammals, unlike their reptilian
ancestors, to derive a biological benefit from social interactions; and (3) the
transition forces a less parsimonious explanation (convergence) for the
evolution of social behavior in birds and mammals, since birds evolved from a
reptilian lineage. Two recently published reviews, however, provided compelling
evidence that the social asocial dichotomy is overly simplistic, neglects the
diversity of vertebrate social systems, impedes our understanding of the
evolution of social behavior, and perpetuates the erroneous belief that one
group, non-avian reptiles, is incapable of complex social behavior. In the
worst case, if PT depends upon a transition from asocial reptiles to social
mammals, then the ability of PT to explain the evolution of the mammalian ANS
is highly questionable. A great number of social behaviors occur in both
reptiles and mammals. In the best case, PT has misused the terms social and
asocial. Even here, however, the theory would still need to identify a
particular suite of behaviors found in mammals and not reptiles that could be
associated with, or explain, the transition of the ANS, and then replace the
asocial and social labels with more specific descriptors.",2023,http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.09238v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.09238v1
social support,Social Networks and Spatial Mobility: Evidence from Facebook in India,"['Harshil Sahai', 'Michael Bailey']","This paper studies the role of social networks in spatial mobility across
India. Using aggregated and de-identified data from the world's largest online
social network, we (i) document new descriptive findings on the structure of
social networks and spatial mobility in India; (ii) quantify the effects of
social networks on annual migration choice; and (iii) embed these estimates in
a spatial equilibrium model to study the wage implications of increasing social
connectedness. Across millions of individuals, we find that multiple measures
of social capital are concentrated among the rich and educated and among
migrants. Across destinations, both mobility patterns and social networks are
concentrated toward richer areas. A model of migration suggests individuals are
indifferent between a 10% increase in destination wages and a 12-16% increase
in destination social networks. Accounting for networks reduces the
migration-distance relationship by 19%. In equilibrium, equalizing social
networks across locations improves average wages by 3% (24% for the bottom
wage-quartile), a larger impact than removing the marginal cost of distance. We
find evidence of an economic support mechanism, with destination economic
improvements reducing the migration-network elasticity. We also find suggestive
evidence for an emotional support mechanism from qualitative surveys among
Facebook users. Difference-in-difference estimates suggest college attendance
delivers a 20% increase in network size and diversity. Taken together, our data
suggest that - by reducing effective moving costs - increasing social
connectedness across space may have considerable economic gains.",2022,http://arxiv.org/abs/2203.05595v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.05595v1

to improve the quality of human life in recent years. Socially assistive robots
(SAR) are a special type of social robots that focus on providing support

robots can vary, depending on the target user groups. In this work, I assess
the effect of socially assistive robots' roles, functions, and communication
approaches in the context of a social agent providing service or companionship

exploratory study of interaction design for a socially assistive robot that
supports people suffering from developmental disabilities. While exploring the
impacts of visual elements to robot's visual interface and different aspects of
robot's social dimension, I developed a series of prototypes and tested them
through three user studies that included three residents with various function
levels at a local group home for people with developmental disabilities. All
user studies had been recorded for the following qualitative data analysis.
Results show that each design factor played a different role in delivering
information and in increasing engagement, and there are more aspects of HRI to
consider besides robot's graphical user interface and speech, such as proxemics
and robot's physical appearance and dimensions. I also note that some
fundamental design principles that would work for ordinary users did not apply
to our target user group. I conclude that socially assistive robots could
benefit our target users and acknowledge that these robots were not suitable
for certain scenarios based on the feedback from our users.",2022,http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.00840v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2301.00840v1
social support,Helper Recommendation with seniority control in Online Health Community,"['Junruo Gao', 'Chen Ling', 'Carl Yang', 'Liang Zhao']","Online health communities (OHCs) are forums where patients with similar
conditions communicate their experiences and provide moral support. Social
support in OHCs plays a crucial role in easing and rehabilitating patients.
However, many time-sensitive questions from patients often remain unanswered
due to the multitude of threads and the random nature of patient visits in
OHCs. To address this issue, it is imperative to propose a recommender system
that assists solution seekers in finding appropriate problem helpers.
Nevertheless, developing a recommendation algorithm to enhance social support
in OHCs remains an under-explored area. Traditional recommender systems cannot
be directly adapted due to the following obstacles. First, unlike user-item
links in traditional recommender systems, it is hard to model the social
support behind helper-seeker links in OHCs since they are formed based on
various heterogeneous reasons. Second, it is difficult to distinguish the
impact of historical activities in characterizing patients. Third, it is
significantly challenging to ensure that the recommended helpers possess
sufficient expertise to assist the seekers. To tackle the aforementioned
challenges, we develop a Monotonically regularIzed diseNTangled Variational

  women","['Aurelie Nakamura', 'Fabienne El-Khoury', 'Anne-Laure Sutter-Dallay', 'Jeanna-Eve Franck', 'Xavier Thierry', 'Maria Melchior', 'Judith van der Waerden']","Background An advantaged socioeconomic position (SEP) and satisfying social
support during pregnancy (SSP) have been found to be protective factors of
maternal postpartum depression (PDD). An advantaged SEP is also associated with
satisfying SSP, making SSP a potential mediator of social inequalities in PPD.
SEP, SSP and PPD are associated with migrant status. The aim of this study was
to quantify the mediating role of SSP in social inequalities in PPD regarding
mother's migrant status. Methods A sub-sample of 15,000 mothers from the French
nationally-representative ELFE cohort study was used for the present analyses.
SEP was constructed as a latent variable measured with educational attainment,
occupational grade, employment, financial difficulties and household income.
SSP was characterized as perceived support from partner (good relation,
satisfying support and paternal leave) and actual support from midwives
(psychosocial risk factors assessment and antenatal education). Mediation
analyses with multiple mediators, stratified by migrant status were conducted.
Results Study population included 76% of non-migrant women, 12% of second and
12% of first generation migrant. SEP was positively associated with support
from partner, regardless of migrant status. Satisfying partner support was
associated with a 8 (non-migrant women) to 11% (first generation migrant women)
reduction in PPD score. Limitations History of depression was not
reported.Conclusions Partner support could reduce social inequalities in PPD.
This work supports the need of interventions, longitudinal and qualitative
studies including fathers and adapted to women at risk of PPD to better
understand the role of SSP in social inequalities in PPD. Keywords social

bonding plays a powerful role in regulating behaviours, emotions, and even

operationalizing the phenomenon of social bonding between human-robot dyads. We
will discuss a number of biobehavioural proxies of social bonding, moving away
from existing approaches that use subjective, psychological measures, and
instead grounding our approach in some of the evolutionary, neurobiological and
physiological correlates of social bond formation in natural systems: (a)
reductions in physiological stress (the ''social buffering'' phenomenon), (b)
narrowing of spatial proximity between dyads, and (c) inter-dyad behavioural
synchrony. We provide relevant evolutionary support for each proposed
component, with suggestions and considerations for how they can be recorded in

  Emotion using Self Structuring Incremental Machine Learning",['Tharindu Bandaragoda'],"This thesis develops a conceptual framework considering social data as
representing the surface layer of a hierarchy of human social behaviours, needs
and cognition which is employed to transform social data into representations
that preserve social behaviours and their causalities. Based on this framework
two platforms were built to capture insights from fast-paced and slow-paced
social data. For fast-paced, a self-structuring and incremental learning
technique was developed to automatically capture salient topics and
corresponding dynamics over time. An event detection technique was developed to
automatically monitor those identified topic pathways for significant
fluctuations in social behaviours using multiple indicators such as volume and
sentiment. This platform is demonstrated using two large datasets with over 1
million tweets. The separated topic pathways were representative of the key
topics of each entity and coherent against topic coherence measures. Identified
events were validated against contemporary events reported in news. Secondly
for the slow-paced social data, a suite of new machine learning and natural
language processing techniques were developed to automatically capture
self-disclosed information of the individuals such as demographics, emotions
and timeline of personal events. This platform was trialled on a large text
corpus of over 4 million posts collected from online support groups. This was
further extended to transform prostate cancer related online support group
discussions into a multidimensional representation and investigated the
self-disclosed quality of life of patients (and partners) against time,

  Analysis","['Xiangguo Sun', 'Hong Cheng', 'Bo Liu', 'Jia Li', 'Hongyang Chen', 'Guandong Xu', 'Hongzhi Yin']","Modern sociology has profoundly uncovered many convincing social criteria for
behavioural analysis. Unfortunately, many of them are too subjective to be
measured and presented in online social networks. On the other hand, data
mining techniques can better find data patterns but many of them leave behind
unnatural understanding. In this paper, we propose a fundamental methodology to
support the further fusion of data mining techniques and sociological
behavioral criteria. Our highlights are three-fold: First, we propose an
effective hypergraph awareness and a fast line graph construction framework.
The hypergraph can more profoundly indicate the interactions between
individuals and their environments because each edge in the hypergraph (a.k.a
hyperedge) contains more than two nodes, which is perfect to describe social
environments. A line graph treats each social environment as a super node with
the underlying influence between different environments. In this way, we go
beyond traditional pair-wise relations and explore richer patterns under
various sociological criteria; Second, we propose a novel hypergraph-based
neural network to learn social influence flowing from users to users, users to
environments, environment to users, and environments to environments. The
neural network can be learned via a task-free method, making our model very
flexible to support various data mining tasks and sociological analysis; Third,
we propose both qualitative and quantitive solutions to effectively evaluate
the most common sociological criteria like social conformity, social
equivalence, environmental evolving and social polarization. Our extensive
experiments show that our framework can better support both data mining tasks
for online user behaviours and sociological analysis.",2022,http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.11440v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.11440v2

genetic evolution of a colony of artificial agents capable of genetic,
individual and social modes of adaptation. We confirm that there is strong
selection pressure to acquire traits of individual learning and social learning
when these are adaptive traits. We show that selection pressure for learning of
either kind can supress selection pressure for reproduction or greater fitness.
We show that social learning differs from individual learning in that it can
support a second evolutionary system that is decoupled from the biological
evolutionary system. This decoupling leads to an emergent interaction where
immature agents are more likely to engage in learning activities than mature

can develop increased levels of their social awareness by keeping in touch with
old friends, making new friends, dispense new data or product, and getting
information in many more aspects of everyday lives, making one to become more
knowledgeable which is very beneficial especially for students. Social
networks, in particular enable users to share and discuss common interests and
provide infrastructures for integrating various user experiences: synchronous
and asynchronous communication, game-playing, sharing links and files. The
trend of using social networks and social media to deliver and exchange
knowledge could bring a new era of social learning in which learners make use
all four language skills of reading, writing, listening and speaking. Unlike a
traditional e-leaning paradigm with pre-defined curriculum and standard
textbooks, social knowledge could be aggregated on demand, just in time, and in
context of engaging challenges from social networks, making learning more
exciting, social and, game-like experience. Social learning environment engages
the learners in discussion, collaboration, exploration, production, discovery

much thought has been given to the exploration of the nature of social links.
Online interactions have been interpreted as indicative of one social process

concept. Our research aims to breach this gap in computational social science
by proposing an unsupervised, parameter-free method to discover, with high
accuracy, the fundamental domains of interaction occurring in social networks.
By applying this method on two online datasets different by scope and type of
interaction (aNobii and Flickr) we observe the spontaneous emergence of three
domains of interaction representing the exchange of status, knowledge and
social support. By finding significant relations between the domains of
interaction and classic social network analysis issues (e.g., tie strength,
dyadic interaction over time) we show how the network of interactions induced
by the extracted domains can be used as a starting point for more nuanced
analysis of online social data that may one day incorporate the normative

Therefore, understanding the structure of the Twitter social graph is

information propagation in Twitter is constrained by its inner structure. In
this paper, we present an in-depth study of the macroscopic structure of the

we present a methodology to unveil the macroscopic structure of the Twitter
social graph. This macroscopic structure consists of 8 components defined by
their connectivity characteristics. Each component group users with a specific
usage of Twitter. For instance, we identified components gathering together

social support,"Contributive Social Capital Extraction From Different Types of Online
  Data Sources","['Sebastian Schams', 'Georg Groh']","It is a recurring problem of online communication that the properties of
unknown people are hard to assess. This may lead to various issues such as the
spread of `fake news' from untrustworthy sources. In sociology the sum of
(social) resources available to a person through their social network is often
described as social capital. In this article, we look at social capital from a
different angle. Instead of evaluating the advantage that people have because
of their membership in a certain group, we investigate various ways to infer
the social capital a person adds or may add to the network, their contributive
social capital (CSC). As there is no consensus in the literature on what the
social capital of a person exactly consists of, we look at various related
properties: expertise, reputation, trustworthiness, and influence. The analysis
of these features is investigated for five different sources of online data:
microblogging (e.g., Twitter), social networking platforms (e.g., Facebook),
direct communication (e.g., email), scientometrics, and threaded discussion
boards (e.g., Reddit). In each field we discuss recent publications and put a
focus on the data sources used, the algorithms implemented, and the performance
evaluation. The findings are compared and set in context to contributive social
capital extraction. The analysis algorithms are based on individual features
(e.g., followers on Twitter), ratios thereof, or a person's centrality measures
(e.g., PageRank). The machine learning approaches, such as straightforward
classifiers (e.g., support vector machines) use ground truths that are
connected to social capital. The discussion of these methods is intended to
facilitate research on the topic by identifying relevant data sources and the
best suited algorithms, and by providing tested methods for the evaluation of
findings.",2019,http://arxiv.org/abs/1902.07636v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1902.07636v1

perspective of researchers or the perspective of support specialists. This
separation is problematic, as it becomes easy for support specialists to build
infrastructures and services based on perceptions of researchers' practices,
rather than the practices themselves. This paper brings together and analyzes
both perspectives to support the building of effective infrastructures and
services for data discovery. Methods: This is a meta-synthesis of work the
authors have conducted over the last six years investigating the data discovery
practices of researchers from different disciplines, with a focus on the social
sciences, and support specialists. We bring together and re-analyze data
collected from in-depth interview studies with 6 support specialists in the
field of social science in Germany, with 21 social scientists in Singapore, an
interview with 10 researchers and 3 support specialists from multiple
disciplines, a global survey with 1630 researchers and 47 support specialists
from multiple disciplines, an observational study with 12 researchers from the
field of social science and a use case analysis of 25 support specialists from
multiple disciplines. Results: We found that there are many similarities in
what researchers and support specialists want and think about data discovery,
both in social sciences and in other disciplines. There are, however, some
differences which we have identified, most notably the interconnection of data
discovery with web search, literature search and social networks. Conclusion:
We conclude by proposing recommendations for how different types of support

  Sex-Industry Posts to Enable Better Support for Those Experiencing
  Sex-Trafficking",['Ellie Simonson'],"Social media is both helpful and harmful to the work against sex trafficking.
On one hand, social workers carefully use social media to support people
experiencing sex trafficking. On the other hand, traffickers use social media
to groom and recruit people into trafficking situations. There is the
opportunity to use social media data to better provide support for people
experiencing trafficking.
  While AI and Machine Learning (ML) have been used in work against sex
trafficking, they predominantly focus on detecting Child Sexual Abuse Material.
Work using social media data has not been done with the intention to provide
community level support to people of all ages experiencing trafficking. Within
this context, this thesis explores the use of semi-supervised classification to
identify social media posts that are a part of the sex industry.
  Several methods were explored for ML. However, the primary method used was
semi-supervised learning, which has the benefit of providing automated
classification with a limited set of labelled data. Social media posts were
embedded into low-dimensional vectors using FastText and Doc2Vec models. The
data were then clustered using k-means clustering, and cross-validation was
used to determine label propagation accuracy.
  The results of the semi-supervised algorithm were encouraging. The FastText
CBOW model provided 98.6% accuracy to over 12,000 posts in clusters where label
propagation was applied. The results of this thesis suggest that further
semi-supervised learning, in conjunction with manual labeling, may allow for
the entire dataset containing over 50,000 posts to be accurately labeled.
  A fully labeled dataset could be used to develop a tool to identify an
overview of where and when social media is used within the sex industry. This
could be used to help determine better ways to provide support to people
experiencing trafficking.",2021,http://arxiv.org/abs/2104.03233v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.03233v1

capital measured on social networks is spatially more concentrated for
residents of lower-income neighborhoods than for residents of higher-income
neighborhoods. We map the micro-geography of individual online social
connections in the 50 largest metropolitan areas of the US using a large-scale
geolocalized Twitter dataset. We then analyze the spatial dimension of
individual social capital by the share of friends, closure, and share of
supported ties within circles of short distance radiuses (1, 5, and 10~km)
around users' home location. We compare residents from below-median income
neighborhoods with above-median income neighborhoods, and find that users
living in relatively poorer neighborhoods have a significantly higher share of
connections in close proximity. Moreover, their network is more cohesive and
supported within a short distance from their home. These patterns prevail
across the 50 largest US metropolitan areas with only a few exceptions. The
found disparities in the micro-geographic concentration of social capital can
feed segregation and income inequality within cities harming social circles of

  evidence",['Bradly Alicea'],"This paper will introduce a theory of emergent animal social complexity using
various results from computational models and empirical results. These results
will be organized into a vertical model of social complexity. This will support
the perspective that social complexity is in essence an emergent phenomenon
while helping to answer two interrelated questions. The first of these involves
how behavior is integrated at units of analysis larger than the individual
organism. The second involves placing aggregate social events into the context
of processes occurring within individual organisms over time (e.g. genomic and
physiological processes). By using a complex systems perspective, five
principles of social complexity can be identified. These principles suggest
that lower-level mechanisms give rise to high-level mechanisms, ultimately
resulting in metastable networks of social relations. These network structures
then constrain lower-level phenomena ranging from transient, collective social
groups to physiological regulatory mechanisms within individual organisms. In
conclusion, the broader implications and drawbacks of applying the theory to a
diversity of natural populations will be discussed.",2013,http://arxiv.org/abs/1309.7990v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1309.7990v2

encouragement, to show compassion and empathy among public. But, it is
difficult to mine the actionable knowledge from large conversational datasets

huge volume, high velocity, and so on. Hence, this paper will propose a novel
framework to model and discover the various themes related to DV from the

strategically induces distinct career choices for individuals from different

segregation equilibria with sustained wage and employment inequality -- in line
with observed patterns of racial or gender labor market disparities. Supporting
the qualitative analysis with a calibration and simulation exercise, we
furthermore show that both first and second best utilitarian social optima
entail segregation, any integration policy requiring explicit distributional
concerns. Our framework highlights that the mere social interaction through
homophilous contact networks can be a pivotal channel for the propagation and
persistence of gender and racial labor market gaps, complementary to long

although powerful in revealing hidden patterns, do not retain meaningful
structure and existing hierarchies within historical social networks. In this

layout create in historical datasets. We explore the importance of hierarchy in
social networks, and investigate whether hierarchies -- strongly present within
our models of social structure -- affect our perception of social network data.
Results from our user evaluation indicate that hierarchical network
representations reduce cognitive load and leads to more frequent and deeper
insights into historical social networks. We also find that users report a

suggested as a mechanism that maintains cooperation in large human groups.
Importantly, models that support this idea have to date only allowed defectors
to be the target of punishment. However, recent empirical work has demonstrated
the existence of anti-social punishment in public goods games. That is,
individuals that defect have been found to also punish cooperators. Some recent
theoretical studies have found that such anti-social punishment can prevent the
evolution of pro-social punishment and cooperation. However, the evolution of
anti-social punishment in group-structured populations has not been formally
addressed. Previous work has informally argued that group-structure must favour
pro-social punishment. Here we formally investigate how two demographic
factors, group size and dispersal frequency, affect selection pressures on pro-
and anti-social punishment. Contrary to the suggestions of previous work, we
find that anti-social punishment can prevent the evolution of pro-social
punishment and cooperation under a range of group structures. Given that
anti-social punishment has now been found in all studied extant human cultures,
the claims of previous models showing the co-evolution of pro-social punishment

people's daily life since it supports new ways of communicating effectively and
sharing information. The advantages of these social network services enable
them rapidly growing. However, the rise of social network services is leading
to the increase of unwanted, disruptive information from spammers, malware
discriminators, and other content polluters. Negative effects of social
spammers do not only annoy users, but also lead to financial loss and privacy
issues. There are two main challenges of spammer detection on Twitter. Firstly,
the data of social network scale with a huge volume of streaming social data.
Secondly, spammers continually change their spamming strategy such as changing
content patterns or trying to gain social influence, disguise themselves as far
as possible. With those challenges, it is hard to directly apply traditional
batch learning methods to quickly adapt newly spamming pattern in the
high-volume and real-time social media data. We need an anti-spammer system to
be able to adjust the learning model when getting a label feedback. Moreover,
the data on social media may be unbounded. Then, the system must allow update
efficiency model in both computation and memory requirements. Online learning
is an ideal solution for this problem. These methods incrementally adapt the
learning model with every single feedback and adjust to the changing patterns
of spammers overtime. Our experiments demonstrate that an anti-spam system
based on online learning approach is efficient in fast changing of spammers
comparing with batch learning methods. We also attempt to find the optimal
online learning method and study the effectiveness of various feature sets on

environments is an essential benchmark for long-term robot autonomy. However,
it is not feasible to learn and benchmark social navigation behaviors entirely
in the real world, as learning is data-intensive, and it is challenging to make
safety guarantees during training. Therefore, simulation-based benchmarks that
provide abstractions for social navigation are required. A framework for these
benchmarks would need to support a wide variety of learning approaches, be
extensible to the broad range of social navigation scenarios, and abstract away
the perception problem to focus on social navigation explicitly. While there
have been many proposed solutions, including high fidelity 3D simulators and
grid world approximations, no existing solution satisfies all of the
aforementioned properties for learning and evaluating social navigation
behaviors. In this work, we propose SOCIALGYM, a lightweight 2D simulation
environment for robot social navigation designed with extensibility in mind,
and a benchmark scenario built on SOCIALGYM. Further, we present benchmark
results that compare and contrast human-engineered and model-based learning
approaches to a suite of off-the-shelf Learning from Demonstration (LfD) and
Reinforcement Learning (RL) approaches applied to social robot navigation.
These results demonstrate the data efficiency, task performance, social

frequency analysis identified both medical and non-medical terms associated
with specific ICD10 chapters. The LDA topic modeling analysis extracted 11
topics related to social determinants of health risk factors including
financial status, abuse history, social support, risk of death, and mental
health. In addition, the topic modeling approach captured the variation between
different types of social work notes and across patients with different types

hypotheses. The first states that strong social ties carry the large majority
of interaction events; the second maintains that weak social ties, although
less active, are often relevant for the exchange of especially important
information (e.g., about potential new jobs in Granovetter's work). While
several empirical studies have provided support for the first hypothesis, the
second has been the object of far less scrutiny. A possible reason is that it
involves notions relative to the nature and importance of the information that
are hard to quantify and measure, especially in large scale studies. Here, we
search for empirical validation of both Granovetter's hypotheses. We find clear
empirical support for the first. We also provide empirical evidence and a
quantitative interpretation for the second. We show that attention, measured as
the fraction of interactions devoted to a particular social connection, is high
on weak ties --- possibly reflecting the postulated informational purposes of
such ties --- but also on very strong ties. Data from online social media and
mobile communication reveal network-dependent mixtures of these two effects on
the basis of a platform's typical usage. Our results establish a clear
relationships between attention, importance, and strength of social links, and

represent it, since automatic information processing requires data and
knowledge are organized in structured and semantically related ways. For this
reason, in this paper, we identify and formalize three basic types of SCK based

interrelationships, such as having-role and having-social_relation, among
social contexts, roles and players from the perspective of considering both
contexts and roles as first-order citizens and not generating role instances.
Secondly, we provide a four level structure to identify and formalize the
intrinsic information, such as events and desires, of social contexts, roles

social contexts and roles from the exhibition of players in concrete contexts.

  Eigendecomposition","['Songlei Wang', 'Yifeng Zheng', 'Xiaohua Jia', 'Xun Yi']","Analytics over social graphs allows to extract valuable knowledge and
insights for many fields like community detection, fraud detection, and

where the social graph is not available to a single entity and is decentralized
among a large number of users, each holding only a limited local view about the
whole graph. Collecting the local views for analytics of decentralized social
graphs raises critical privacy concerns, as they encode private information
about the social interactions among individuals. In this paper, we design,
implement, and evaluate PrivGED, a new system aimed at privacy-preserving
analytics over decentralized social graphs. PrivGED focuses on the support for
eigendecomposition, one popular and fundamental graph analytics task producing
eigenvalues/eigenvectors over the adjacency matrix of a social graph and
benefits various practical applications. PrivGED is built from a delicate
synergy of insights on graph analytics, lightweight cryptography, and
differential privacy, allowing users to securely contribute their local views

while the explanations do have some influence on the likelihood, there is
little correlation between the likelihood and actual (listening) rating for the

times of crisis. Gaining intelligence through social media analytics, however,
remains a challenge for government agencies, e.g. due to a lack of training and
instruments. To mitigate this shortcoming, government agencies need tools that
support them in analysing social media data for the public good. This paper
presents a design science research approach that guides the development of a
social media analytics dashboard for a regional government agency. Preliminary
results from a workshop and the resulting design of a first prototype are

geo-located services. In this setting, we explore a new problem, called
Maximizing the Influence of Bichromatic Reverse k Nearest Neighbors

which are geo-textually and socially attractive to social influencers who are
expected to largely promote the POIs through online influence propagation. In
other words, the problem aims to detect an optimal set of POIs with the largest
word-of-mouth (WOM) marketing potential. This functionality is useful in
various real-life applications, including social advertising, location-based
viral marketing, and personalized POI recommendation. However, solving
MaxInfBRkNN with theoretical guarantees is challenging, because of the
prohibitive overheads on BRkNN retrieval in geo-social networks, and the NP and
#P-hardness in finding the optimal POI set. To achieve practical solutions, we
present a framework with carefully designed indexes, efficient batch BRkNN

recoupment of enterprises expenses associated with the implementation of social
and ethical marketing tasks. Therefore, the enterprises, which plan to act on
terms of social and ethical marketing, should monitor the social responsibility
of consumers in the relevant markets. At the same time, special attention
should be paid to the analysis of factors that prevent consumers from
implementing their socially responsible intentions in the regions with a low
level of social activity of consumers. The purpose of the article is to develop
methodological guidelines that determine the tasks and directions of conducting
empirical studies aimed at assessing the gap between the socially responsible
intentions of consumers and the actual implementation of these intentions, as
well as to identify the causes of this gap. An empirical survey of the sampled
consumers in Kharkiv was carried out in terms of the proposed methodological
provisions. It revealed a rather high level of respondents' willingness to
support socially responsible enterprises and a rather low level of
implementation of these intentions due to the lack of consumers awareness. To
test the proposed methodological guidelines, an empirical study of the
consumers social responsibility was conducted in 2017 on a sample of students
and professors of the Semen Kuznets Kharkiv National University of Economics
(120 people). Questioning of the respondents was carried out using the Google

  Window to Public Mental Health","['Michelle Bak', 'Chungyi Chiu', 'Jessie Chin']","Intensified preventive measures during the COVID-19 pandemic, such as
lockdown and social distancing, heavily increased the perception of social
isolation (i.e., a discrepancy between one's social needs and the provisions of
the social environment) among young adults. Social isolation is closely
associated with situational loneliness (i.e., loneliness emerging from
environmental change), a risk factor for depressive symptoms. Prior research
suggested vulnerable young adults are likely to seek support from an online
social platform such as Reddit, a perceived comfortable environment for lonely
individuals to seek mental health help through anonymous communication with a
broad social network. Therefore, this study aims to identify and analyze
depression-related dialogues on loneliness subreddits during the COVID-19
outbreak, with the implications on depression-related infoveillance during the
pandemic. Our study utilized logistic regression and topic modeling to classify
and examine depression-related discussions on loneliness subreddits before and
during the pandemic. Our results showed significant increases in the volume of
depression-related discussions (i.e., topics related to mental health, social
interaction, family, and emotion) where challenges were reported during the
pandemic. We also found a switch in dominant topics emerging from
depression-related discussions on loneliness subreddits, from dating
(prepandemic) to online interaction and community (pandemic), suggesting the
increased expressions or need of online social support during the pandemic. The
current findings suggest the potential of social media to serve as a window for
monitoring public mental health. Our future study will clinically validate the
current approach, which has implications for designing a surveillance system
during the crisis.",2022,http://arxiv.org/abs/2203.00237v4,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.00237v4

maintenance experience of SNSAPI, a Python-based middleware which unifies the
interfaces and data structures of heterogeneous Social Networking Services
(SNS). Unlike most prior works, our middleware is user-oriented and requires
zero infrastructure support. It enables a user to readily conduct online social
activities in a programmable, cross-platform fashion while gradually reducing
the dependence on centralized Online Social Networks (OSN). More importantly,
as the SNSAPI middleware can be used to support decentralized social networking
services via conventional communication channels such as RSS or Email, it
enables the deployment of Decentralized Social Networks (DSN) in an
incremental, ad hoc manner. To demonstrate the viability of such type of DSNs,
we have deployed an experimental 6000-node SNSAPI-based DSN on PlanetLab and
evaluate its performance by replaying traces of online social activities
collected from a mainstream OSN. Our results show that, with only mild resource
consumption, the SNSAPI-based DSN can achieve acceptable forwarding latency
comparable to that of a centralized OSN. We also develop an analytical model to
characterize the trade-offs between resource consumption and message forwarding
delay in our DSN. Via 20 parameterized experiments on PlanetLab, we have found
that the empirical measurement results match reasonably with the performance
predicted by our analytical model.",2014,http://arxiv.org/abs/1403.4482v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1403.4482v1

  Social Sensor Data Filtering","['Abhijit Suprem', 'Calton Pu']","Physical event detection has long been the domain of static event processors
operating on numeric sensor data. This works well for large scale strong-signal
events such as hurricanes, and important classes of events such as earthquakes.
However, for a variety of domains there is insufficient sensor coverage, e.g.,
landslides, wildfires, and flooding. Social networks have provided massive
volume of data from billions of users, but data from these generic social
sensors contain much more noise than physical sensors. One of the most
difficult challenges presented by social sensors is \textit{concept drift},
where the terms associated with a phenomenon evolve and change over time,
rendering static machine learning (ML) classifiers less effective. To address
this problem, we develop the ASSED (Adaptive Social Sensor Event Detection)
framework with an ML-based event processing engine and show how it can perform
simple and complex physical event detection on strong- \textit{and} weak-signal
with low-latency, high scalability, and accurate coverage. Specifically, ASSED
is a framework to support continuous filter generation and updates with machine
learning using streaming data from high-confidence sources (physical and
annotated sensors) and social networks. We build ASSED to support procedures
for integrating high-confidence sources into social sensor event detection to
generate high-quality filters and to perform dynamic filter selection by
tracking its own performance. We demonstrate ASSED capabilities through a
landslide detection application that detects almost 350\% more landslides
compared to static approaches. More importantly, ASSED automates the handling
of concept drift: four years after initial data collection and classifier
training, ASSED achieves event detection accuracy of 0.988 (without expert
manual intervention), compared to 0.762 for static approaches.",2019,http://arxiv.org/abs/1909.07596v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.07596v1

  Comprehension in Support Agents","['Ilir Kola', 'Catholijn M. Jonker', 'M. Birna van Riemsdijk']","Support agents that help users in their daily lives need to take into account
not only the user's characteristics, but also the social situation of the user.
Existing work on including social context uses some type of situation cue as an
input to information processing techniques in order to assess the expected
behavior of the user. However, research shows that it is important to also
determine the meaning of a situation, a step which we refer to as social
situation comprehension. We propose using psychological characteristics of
situations, which have been proposed in social science for ascribing meaning to
situations, as the basis for social situation comprehension. Using data from
user studies, we evaluate this proposal from two perspectives. First, from a
technical perspective, we show that psychological characteristics of situations
can be used as input to predict the priority of social situations, and that
psychological characteristics of situations can be predicted from the features
of a social situation. Second, we investigate the role of the comprehension
step in human-machine meaning making. We show that psychological
characteristics can be successfully used as a basis for explanations given to

individual needs to reduce uncertainty about the outcomes of interactions in
one or more dimension. The proposal grounds social network dynamics and
evolution in individual selection processes and allows us to define the
uncertainty of the social network as the joint entropy of its constituent
interaction networks. In support of these propositions we use simulations and
natural 'knock-outs' in a free-ranging baboon troop to show (i) that such an
object can display a small-world state and (ii) that, as predicted, changes in
interactions after social perturbations lead to a more certain social network,
in which the outcomes of interactions are easier for members to predict. This
new formalisation of social networks provides a framework within which to

allow the query of a user's local neighborhood through the interface. To enable
analytics over such an online social network through its restrictive web
interface, many recent efforts reuse the existing Markov Chain Monte Carlo
methods such as random walks to sample the social network and support analytics
based on the samples. The problem with such an approach, however, is the large
amount of queries often required (i.e., a long ""mixing time"") for a random walk
to reach a desired (stationary) sampling distribution.
  In this paper, we consider a novel problem of enabling a faster random walk
over online social networks by ""rewiring"" the social network on-the-fly.
Specifically, we develop Modified TOpology (MTO)-Sampler which, by using only
information exposed by the restrictive web interface, constructs a ""virtual""
overlay topology of the social network while performing a random walk, and
ensures that the random walk follows the modified overlay topology rather than
the original one. We show that MTO-Sampler not only provably enhances the
efficiency of sampling, but also achieves significant savings on query cost

  and Ascribed Traits","['Jeff Alstott', 'Stuart Madnick', 'Chander Velu']","Large-scale mobilization of individuals across social networks is becoming
increasingly prevalent in society. However, little is known about what affects
the speed of social mobilization. Here we use a framed field experiment to
identify and measure properties of individuals and their relationships that
predict mobilization speed. We ran a global social mobilization contest and
recorded personal traits of the participants and those they recruited. We
studied the effects of ascribed traits (gender, age) and acquired traits
(geography, and information source) on the speed of mobilization. We found that
homophily, a preference for interacting with other individuals with similar
traits, had a mixed role in social mobilization. Homophily was present for
acquired traits, in which mobilization speed was faster when the recuiter and
recruit had the same trait compared to different traits. In contrast, we did
not find support for homophily for the ascribed traits. Instead, those traits
had other, non-homophily effects: Females mobilized other females faster than
males mobilized other males. Younger recruiters mobilized others faster, and
older recruits mobilized slower. Recruits also mobilized faster when they first
heard about the contest directly from the contest organization, and decreased
in speed when hearing from less personal source types (e.g. family vs. media).
These findings show that social mobilization includes dynamics that are unlike
other, more passive forms of social activity propagation. These findings
suggest relevant factors for engineering social mobilization tasks for
increased speed.",2014,http://arxiv.org/abs/1404.6935v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1404.6935v1

considerably important for autonomous robots, which support human activities.
One of the practical approaches for acquiring such social interaction skills
and semantic information as common sense in human activity is the application
of recent machine learning techniques. Although recent machine learning
techniques have been successful in realizing automatic manipulation and driving
tasks, it is difficult to use these techniques in applications that require
human-robot interaction experience. Humans have to perform several times over a
long term to show embodied and social interaction behaviors to robots or
learning systems. To address this problem, we propose a cloud-based immersive
virtual reality (VR) platform which enables virtual human-robot interaction to
collect the social and embodied knowledge of human activities in a variety of
situations. To realize the flexible and reusable system, we develop a real-time
bridging mechanism between ROS and Unity, which is one of the standard
platforms for developing VR applications. We apply the proposed system to a
robot competition field named RoboCup@Home to confirm the feasibility of the
system in a realistic human-robot interaction scenario. Through demonstration
experiments at the competition, we show the usefulness and potential of the
system for the development and evaluation of social intelligence through
human-robot interaction. The proposed VR platform enables robot systems to
collect social experiences with several users in a short time. The platform
also contributes in providing a dataset of social behaviors, which would be a

  and Topological Features",['Mohammad G. Raeini'],"Link prediction is an important task in social network analysis. There are
different characteristics (features) in a social network that can be used for
link prediction. In this paper, we evaluate the effectiveness of aggregated
features and topological features in link prediction using supervised learning.
The aggregated features, in a social network, are some aggregation functions of
the attributes of the nodes. Topological features describe the topology or
structure of a social network, and its underlying graph. We evaluated the
effectiveness of these features by measuring the performance of different
supervised machine learning methods. Specifically, we selected five well-known
supervised methods including J48 decision tree, multi-layer perceptron (MLP),
support vector machine (SVM), logistic regression and Naive Bayes (NB). We
measured the performance of these five methods with different sets of features
of the DBLP Dataset. Our results indicate that the combination of aggregated
and topological features generates the best performance. For evaluation
purposes, we used accuracy, area under the ROC curve (AUC) and F-Measure.
  Our selected features can be used for the analysis of almost any social
network. This is because these features provide the important characteristics
of the underlying graph of the social networks. The significance of our work is
that the selected features can be very effective in the analysis of big social
networks. In such networks we usually deal with big data sets, with millions or
billions of instances. Using fewer, but more effective, features can help us

of a community and social tie, to support data dissemination. The simulation
results show that Int-Tree achieves higher delivery ratio, lower overhead, in
comparison to two benchmark protocols, PROPHET and Epidemic routing. In
addition, Int-Tree can perform with 1.36 hop counts in average, and tolerable

oscillation model) is a theoretical model proposed to describe user dynamics in
online social networks. This model can be used to understand the relationship
between explosive user dynamics and the structure of social networks. However,
since the oscillation model was introduced as a purely theoretical model of
social networks, it is necessary to confirm whether the model describes real
phenomena correctly or not. In this paper, we first show a prediction from the
oscillation model; the low-frequency oscillation mode of user dynamics will be
dominant when the structure of online social networks changes so that user
activity is activated. To verify the predictions with actual data, we show
spectral analyses of both the log data of posts on an electronic bulletin board

social support,Interdependent Diffusion: The social contagion of interacting beliefs,['James P. Houghton'],"Social contagion is the process in which people adopt a belief, idea, or
practice from a neighbor and pass it along to someone else. For over 100 years,
scholars of social contagion have almost exclusively made the same implicit
assumption: that only one belief, idea, or practice spreads through the
population at a time. It is a default assumption that we don't bother to state,
let alone justify. The assumption is so ingrained that our literature doesn't
even have a word for ""whatever is to be diffused"", because we have never needed
to discuss more than one of them. But this assumption is obviously false.
Millions of beliefs, ideas, and practices (let's call them ""diffusants"") spread
through social contagion every day. To assume that diffusants spread one at a
time - or more generously, that they spread independently of one another - is
to assume that interactions between diffusants have no influence on adoption
patterns. This could be true, or it could be wildly off the mark. We've never
stopped to find out. This paper makes a direct comparison between the spread of
independent and interdependent beliefs using simulations, observational data,
and a 2400-subject laboratory experiment. I find that in assuming independence
between diffusants, scholars have overlooked social processes that
fundamentally change the outcomes of social contagion. Interdependence between
beliefs generates polarization, irrespective of social network structure,
homophily, demographics, politics, or any other commonly cited cause. It also
coordinates structures of beliefs that can have both internal justification and
social support without any grounding in external truth.",2020,http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.02188v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.02188v3

offloading some interactions to the avatar. We model the setting and identify
the characteristic variables by using selected concepts from social sciences:
ego networks, social presence, and social cues. Then, we formulate the problem

community where a significant part of the user base are self-reported
supporters of QAnon, a far-right conspiracy theory alleging that a cabal of
elites controls global politics. QAnon is considered to have had an influential
role in the public discourse during the 2020 U.S. presidential election.
However, little is known about QAnon supporters on Parler and what sets them
aside from other users. Building up on social identity theory, we aim at
profiling the characteristics of QAnon supporters on Parler. We analyze a
large-scale dataset with more than 600,000 profiles of English-speaking users
on Parler. Based on users' profiles, posts, and comments, we then extract a
comprehensive set of user features, linguistic features, network features, and
content features. This allows us to perform user profiling and understand to
what extent these features discriminate between QAnon and non-QAnon supporters
on Parler. Our analysis is three-fold: (1) We quantify the number of QAnon
supporters on Parler, finding that 34,913 users (5.5% of all users) openly
report to support the conspiracy. (2) We examine differences between QAnon vs.
non-QAnon supporters. We find that QAnon supporters differ statistically
significantly from non-QAnon supporters across multiple dimensions. For
example, they have, on average, a larger number of followers, followees, and
posts, and thus have a large impact on the Parler network. (3) We use machine
learning to identify which user characteristics discriminate QAnon from
non-QAnon supporters. We find that user features, linguistic features, network
features, and content features, can - to a large extent - discriminate QAnon

activities. Social media is now an indispensable mode of communication; online
gaming is not only a genuine social activity but also a popular spectator
sport. With support for anonymity and larger audiences, online interaction
shrinks social and geographical barriers. Despite such benefits, social
disparities such as gender inequality persist in online social media. In
particular, online gaming communities have been criticized for persistent
gender disparities and objectification. As gaming evolves into a social
platform, persistence of gender disparity is a pressing question. Yet, there
are few large-scale, systematic studies of gender inequality and
objectification in social gaming platforms. Here we analyze more than one
billion chat messages from Twitch, a social game-streaming platform, to study
how the gender of streamers is associated with the nature of conversation.
Using a combination of computational text analysis methods, we show that
gendered conversation and objectification is prevalent in chats. Female
streamers receive significantly more objectifying comments while male streamers
receive more game-related comments. This difference is more pronounced for
popular streamers. There also exists a large number of users who post only on
female or male streams. Employing a neural vector-space embedding (paragraph
vector) method, we analyze gendered chat messages and create prediction models
that (i) identify the gender of streamers based on messages posted in the
channel and (ii) identify the gender a viewer prefers to watch based on their

from Sept. 2015 to Jan. 2016, we first uncover the tweeting tactics of the
candidates and second, using negative binomial regression and exploiting the
variations in 'likes,' we evaluate the effectiveness of these tactics. Thirdly,
we rank the candidates' campaign tactics by calculating the conditional
expectation of their generated 'likes.'
  We show that while Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio put much weight on President
Obama, this tactic is not being well received by their supporters. We
demonstrate that Hillary Clinton's tactic of linking herself to President Obama
resonates well with her supporters but the same is not true for Bernie Sanders.
In addition, we show that Donald Trump is a major topic for all the other
candidates and that the women issue is equally emphasized in Sanders' campaign
as in Clinton's.
  Finally, we suggest two ways that politicians can use the feedback mechanism
in social media to improve their campaign: (1) use feedback from social media
to improve campaign tactics within social media; (2) prototype policies and
test the public response from the social media.",2017,http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.02042v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1704.02042v1

frame around their activity. The proposed scheme (1) assigns time-decay
causality scores to users, (2) applies a community detection-based algorithm to
group of users sharing similar causality scores and finally (3) deploys a

successful health-related behavior change. However, most of the existing
studies look at the effect that offline social feedback has. This paper fills
gaps in the literature by proposing a framework to study the causal effect that
receiving social support in the form of comments in an online weight loss
community has on (i) the probability of the user to return to the forum, and,
more importantly, on (ii) the weight loss reported by the user. Using a
matching approach for causal inference we observe a difference of 9 lbs lost
between users who do or do not receive comments. Surprisingly, this effect is
mediated by neither an increase in lifetime in the community nor by an
increased activity level of the user. Our results show the importance that a
""warm welcome"" has when using online support forums to achieve health outcomes.",2017,http://arxiv.org/abs/1701.05225v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1701.05225v1

are driven to conversations about extreme behaviors, like fasting, to achieve
the ``thin body'' goal, and how these conversations are validated by pro-ana
communities. By facilitating social connections to like-minded others, a shared
group identity and emotional support, social media platforms can trap

social support,Social value and information quality in online health information search,"['Tahir Hameed', 'Bobby Swar']","This paper extends and validates a model of value-driven online healthcare
information search in online shared contexts. Perceived value is an important
factor behind users' decisions concerning search, consumption and reuse of
products and services. The role of utilitarian, hedonic and epistemic value of
information in user satisfaction and intention to repeat online search is well
recognized, but little support has been found for social value affecting user
satisfaction critical for such decisions. Therefore, a value-based model of
online healthcare information search was extended adding detailed information
quality measures. Our survey data collected from 143 college going students
from more than 10 countries studying in South Korea demonstrated two novel
results. At first, unlike existing studies, strong support was found for
perceived social value affecting the user satisfaction. As a second substantial
finding, the significance of social value could only be appreciated by using
comprehensive constructs of information quality than simpler measures.
Therefore, this study shows for social and shared HIS, users consider access,
representation and context quality of healthcare information to be more
important from social perspective than intrinsic (or content) quality.
Therefore, developers and healthcare organizations interested in traction of
their online healthcare information delivery systems (HIS), especially those

quality of their systems accordingly.",2016,http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.03507v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1606.03507v1
social support,On social networks that support learning,"['Itai Arieli', 'Fedor Sandomirskiy', 'Rann Smorodinsky']","It is well understood that the structure of a social network is critical to
whether or not agents can aggregate information correctly. In this paper, we
study social networks that support information aggregation when rational agents
act sequentially and irrevocably. Whether or not information is aggregated
depends, inter alia, on the order in which agents decide. Thus, to decouple the
order and the topology, our model studies a random arrival order.
  Unlike the case of a fixed arrival order, in our model, the decision of an
agent is unlikely to be affected by those who are far from him in the network.
This observation allows us to identify a local learning requirement, a natural
condition on the agent's neighborhood that guarantees that this agent makes the
correct decision (with high probability) no matter how well other agents
perform. Roughly speaking, the agent should belong to a multitude of mutually
exclusive social circles.
  We illustrate the power of the local learning requirement by constructing a
family of social networks that guarantee information aggregation despite that
no agent is a social hub (in other words, there are no opinion leaders).
Although the common wisdom of the social learning literature suggests that
information aggregation is very fragile, another application of the local
learning requirement demonstrates the existence of networks where learning
prevails even if a substantial fraction of the agents are not involved in the
learning process. On a technical level, the networks we construct rely on the
theory of expander graphs, i.e., highly connected sparse graphs with a wide
range of applications from pure mathematics to error-correcting codes.",2020,http://arxiv.org/abs/2011.05255v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.05255v1

access to opportunities. To date, however, the correspondence between tie
strength and population's economic prospects has not been quantified, largely
because of the inability to operationalise strength based on Granovetter's
classic theory. Our work departed from the premise that tie strength is a
unidimensional construct (typically operationalized with frequency or volume of
contact), and used instead a validated model of ten fundamental dimensions of
social relationships grounded in the literature of social psychology. We built
state-of-the-art NLP tools to infer the presence of these dimensions from
textual communication, and analyzed a large conversation network of 630K
geo-referenced Reddit users across the entire US connected by 12.8M social ties
created over the span of 7 years. We found that unidimensional tie strength is
only weakly correlated with economic opportunities (R2=0.30), while
multidimensional constructs are highly correlated (R2=0.62). In particular,
economic opportunities are associated to the combination of: i) knowledge ties,
which bridge geographically distant groups, facilitating the knowledge
dissemination across communities; and ii) social support ties, which knit
geographically close communities together, and represent dependable sources of
social and emotional support. These results point to the importance of
developing high-quality measures of tie strength in network theory.",2022,http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.11932v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.11932v1

analysed an experiment where subjects had to repeatedly guess the correct
answer to factual questions, while having only aggregated information about the
answers of others. While the response of humans to aggregated information is a
widely observed phenomenon, it has not been investigated quantitatively, in a
controlled setting. We found that the adjustment of individual guesses depends
linearly on the distance to the mean of all guesses. This is a remarkable, and
yet surprisingly simple, statistical regularity. It holds across all questions
analysed, even though the correct answers differ in several orders of
magnitude. Our finding supports the assumption that individual diversity does
not affect the response to indirect social influence. It also complements
previous results on the nonlinear response in information-rich scenarios. We

have emerged: augmenting collaborative filtering with social data and

movie and music data from Facebook, and hashtag data from Twitter. We find that
recommendation algorithms based only on friends perform no worse than those
based on the full network, even though they require much less data and
computational resources. Further, our evidence suggests that locality of
preference, or the non-random distribution of item preferences in a social
network, is a driving force behind the value of incorporating social network
information into recommender algorithms. When locality is high, as in Twitter
data, simple k-nn recommenders do better based only on friends than they do if
they draw from the entire network. These results help us understand when, and
why, social network information is likely to support recommendation systems,
and show that systems that see ego-centric slices of a complete network (such
as websites that use Facebook logins) or have computational limitations (such

contributions and communication behaviour, might usefully support companies in
managing critical knowledge resources. Against this backdrop, in this
research-in-progress paper we derive 16 metrics characterising the
participation behaviour, message content and structural position of ESN users
of an Australian professional services firm. Based on a factor analysis, we
identify four distinct dimensions of ESN user behaviour: Contribution &
networking, information provision, contact dispersion and invisible usage. With
this research we contribute to the literature by transferring concepts and
methods of organisation science and social media research to an ESN context.
Further, our approach forms the basis for the identification of different types
of knowledge actors, which might ultimately help to improve organisational
knowledge transparency.",2016,http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.00883v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1606.00883v1
social support,Opinion Polarization by Learning from Social Feedback,"['Sven Banisch', 'Eckehard Olbrich']","We explore a new mechanism to explain polarization phenomena in opinion
dynamics in which agents evaluate alternative views on the basis of the social
feedback obtained on expressing them. High support of the favored opinion in
the social environment, is treated as a positive feedback which reinforces the
value associated to this opinion. In connected networks of sufficiently high
modularity, different groups of agents can form strong convictions of competing
opinions. Linking the social feedback process to standard equilibrium concepts
we analytically characterize sufficient conditions for the stability of
bi-polarization. While previous models have emphasized the polarization effects
of deliberative argument-based communication, our model highlights an affective
experience-based route to polarization, without assumptions about negative
influence or bounded confidence.",2017,http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.02890v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1704.02890v3
social support,Why You Should Charge Your Friends for Borrowing Your Stuff,"['Kijung Shin', 'Euiwoong Lee', 'Dhivya Eswaran', 'Ariel D. Procaccia']","We consider goods that can be shared with k-hop neighbors (i.e., the set of
nodes within k hops from an owner) on a social network. We examine incentives
to buy such a good by devising game-theoretic models where each node decides
whether to buy the good or free ride. First, we find that social inefficiency,
specifically excessive purchase of the good, occurs in Nash equilibria. Second,
the social inefficiency decreases as k increases and thus a good can be shared
with more nodes. Third, and most importantly, the social inefficiency can also
be significantly reduced by charging free riders an access cost and paying it
to owners, leading to the conclusion that organizations and system designers
should impose such a cost. These findings are supported by our theoretical
analysis in terms of the price of anarchy and the price of stability; and by
simulations based on synthetic and real social networks.",2017,http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.07343v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1705.07343v1

widespread problem worldwide. Domestic Violence and Abuse is at the root of so
many issues in society and considered as the societal tabooed topic.
Fortunately, with the popularity of social media, social welfare communities
and victim support groups facilitate the victims to share their abusive stories
and allow others to give advice and help victims. Hence, in order to offer the
immediate resources for those needs, the specific messages from the victims
need to be alarmed from other messages. In this paper, we regard intention
mining as a binary classification problem (abuse or advice) with the usecase of
abuse discourse. To address this problem, we extract rich feature sets from the
raw corpus, using psycholinguistic clues and textual features by term-class
interaction method. Machine learning algorithms are used to predict the
accuracy of the classifiers between two different feature sets. Our
experimental results with high classification accuracy give a promising
solution to understand a big social problem through big social media and its

interpret the HMD user's state -- e.g., attentiveness; the need for assistance

attached to the HMD that supports collaboration by showing the state. We
explore the impact of abstract and realistic visualizations for such displays

textual representation of the user's state and (3) a representation that looks
like the HMD is see-through. The results show positive effects for textual
representation on collaborative performance and a positive effect of realistic

Agents have local resource demand and supply, and are interconnected through a
flow network to support the sharing of local resources while respecting
restricted sharing/flow capacity. We first establish a competitive market with
a pricing mechanism that internalizes flow capacity constraints into agents'
private decisions. We then demonstrate through duality theory that competitive
equilibrium and social welfare equilibrium exist and agree under convexity
assumptions, indicating the efficiency of the pricing mechanism. Additionally,
a new social acceptance sharing problem is defined to investigate homogeneous
pricing when the optimal sharing prices at all agents under competitive
equilibrium are always equal for social acceptance. A conceptual computation
method is proposed, prescribing a class of socially admissible utility

constant social preference. This paper focuses on a specific case of market and
non-market goods, and investigates the optimal climate policy when social
preference for them is also changed by climate policy in the DICE model. The
relative price of non-market goods grows over time due to increases in both
relative scarcity and appreciation of it. Therefore, climbing relative price
brings upward the social cost of carbon denominated in terms of market goods.
Because abatement decision affects the valuation of non-market goods in the
utility function, unlike previous climate-economy models, we solve the model
iteratively by taking the obtained abatement rates from the last run as inputs
in the current run. The results in baseline calibration advocate a more
stringent climate policy, where endogenous social preference to climate policy
raises the social cost of carbon further by roughly 12%-18% this century.
Moreover, neglecting changing social preference leads to an underestimate of
non-market goods damages by 15%. Our results support that climate policy is

People operate within a social network and their opinions depend on those of
the people with whom they interact. Therefore, they may change their opinions
over time, which may mean supporting one particular candidate or none.
Candidates attempt to gain people's support by interacting with them, whether
they are in the same social circle (i.e. neighbors) or not. In particular,
candidates follow a strategy of interacting for a time with people they do not
know (that is, people who are not their neighbors). Our analysis of the
proposed model sought to establish which network strategies are the most
effective for candidates to gain popular support. We found that the most
suitable strategy depends on the topology of the social network. Finally, we
investigated the role of charisma in these dynamics. Charisma is relevant in
several social contexts, since charismatic people usually exercise a strong
influence over others. Our results showed that candidates' charisma is an
important contributory factor to a successful network strategy in election
campaigns.",2013,http://arxiv.org/abs/1311.5933v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1311.5933v2

  in User Rating Prediction","['Seyed Mohammad Taheri', 'Hamidreza Mahyar', 'Mohammad Firouzi', 'Elahe Ghalebi K.', 'Radu Grosu', 'Ali Movaghar']","Recommendation plays an increasingly important role in our daily lives.
Recommender systems automatically suggest items to users that might be
interesting for them. Recent studies illustrate that incorporating social trust
in Matrix Factorization methods demonstrably improves accuracy of rating
prediction. Such approaches mainly use the trust scores explicitly expressed by
users. However, it is often challenging to have users provide explicit trust
scores of each other. There exist quite a few works, which propose Trust
Metrics to compute and predict trust scores between users based on their
interactions. In this paper, first we present how social relation can be
extracted from users' ratings to items by describing Hellinger distance between
users in recommender systems. Then, we propose to incorporate the predicted
trust scores into social matrix factorization models. By analyzing social
relation extraction from three well-known real-world datasets, which both:
trust and recommendation data available, we conclude that using the implicit
social relation in social recommendation techniques has almost the same
performance compared to the actual trust scores explicitly expressed by users.
Hence, we build our method, called Hell-TrustSVD, on top of the
state-of-the-art social recommendation technique to incorporate both the
extracted implicit social relations and ratings given by users on the
prediction of items for an active user. To the best of our knowledge, this is
the first work to extend TrustSVD with extracted social trust information. The
experimental results support the idea of employing implicit trust into matrix
factorization whenever explicit trust is not available, can perform much better
than the state-of-the-art approaches in user rating prediction.",2016,http://arxiv.org/abs/1612.01428v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1612.01428v2
social support,Socioeconomic driving forces of scientific research,['Mario Coccia'],"Why do nations produce scientific research? This is a fundamental problem in
the field of social studies of science. The paper confronts this question here
by showing vital determinants of science to explain the sources of social power
and wealth creation by nations. Firstly, this study suggests a new general
definition of science and scientific research that synthetizes previous
concepts and endeavors to extend them: Science discovers the root causes of
phenomena to explain and predict them in a context of adaptation of life to new
economic and social bases, whereas scientific research is a systematic process,
applying methods of scientific inquiry, to solve consequential problems, to
satisfy human wants, to take advantage of important opportunities and/or to
cope with environmental threats. In particular, science and scientific research
are driven by an organized social effort that inevitably reflect the concerns
and interests of nations to achieve advances and discoveries that are spread to
the rest of humankind. This study reveals that scientific research is produced
for social and economic interests of nations (power, wealth creation,
technological superiority, etc.), rather than philosophical inquiries. A main
implication of this study is that the immense growth of science in modern
society is not only due to activity of scientists but rather to general social
efforts of nations to take advantage of important opportunities and/or to cope
with environmental threats, such as war. Empirical evidence endeavors to
support the sources of scientific research for nations, described here.
Finally, relationships between R&D investment and productivity, and research
policy implications are discussed.",2018,http://arxiv.org/abs/1806.05028v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.05028v1
social support,"Controllability of Social Networks and the Strategic Use of Random
  Information","['Marco Cremonini', 'Francesca Casamassima']","This work is aimed at studying realistic social control strategies for social
networks based on the introduction of random information into the state of
selected driver agents. Deliberately exposing selected agents to random
information is a technique already experimented in recommender systems or
search engines, and represents one of the few options for influencing the
behavior of a social context that could be accepted as ethical, could be fully
disclosed to members, and does not involve the use of force or of deception.
Our research is based on a model of knowledge diffusion applied to a
time-varying adaptive network, and considers two well-known strategies for
influencing social contexts. One is the selection of few influencers for
manipulating their actions in order to drive the whole network to a certain
behavior; the other, instead, drives the network behavior acting on the state
of a large subset of ordinary, scarcely influencing users. The two approaches
have been studied in terms of network and diffusion effects. The network effect
is analyzed through the changes induced on network average degree and
clustering coefficient, while the diffusion effect is based on two ad-hoc
metrics defined to measure the degree of knowledge diffusion and skill level,
as well as the polarization of agent interests. The results, obtained through
simulations on synthetic networks, show a rich dynamics and strong effects on
the communication structure and on the distribution of knowledge and skills,
supporting our hypothesis that the strategic use of random information could
represent a realistic approach to social network controllability, and that with
both strategies, in principle, the control effect could be remarkable.",2018,http://arxiv.org/abs/1807.07761v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1807.07761v1

increased over recent years. There is a plethora of information flow over the
different topics of discussion, which is widespread across different domains.
The ease of information sharing has increased noisy data being induced along
with the relevant data stream. Finding such relevant data is important,
especially when we are dealing with a time-critical domain like disasters. It
is also more important to filter the relevant data in a real-time setting to
timely process and leverage the information for decision support.
  However, the short text and sometimes ungrammatical nature of social media
data challenge the extraction of contextual information cues, which could help
differentiate relevant vs. non-relevant information. This paper presents a
novel method to classify relevant social media posts during disaster events by
ensembling the features of both domain-specific word embeddings as well as more
generic domain-agnostic word embeddings. Therefore, we develop and evaluate a
hybrid feature engineering framework for integrating diverse semantic
representations using a combination of word embeddings to efficiently classify
a relevant social media post. The application of the proposed classification
framework could help in filtering public posts at large scale, given the

communication and sociocultural influence. But, while language change has long
been a topic of study in sociolinguistics, traditional linguistic research
methods rely on circumstantial evidence, estimating the direction of change
from differences between older and younger speakers. In this paper, we use a
data set of several million Twitter users to track language changes in
progress. First, we show that language change can be viewed as a form of social
influence: we observe complex contagion for phonetic spellings and ""netspeak""
abbreviations (e.g., lol), but not for older dialect markers from spoken
language. Next, we test whether specific types of social network connections
are more influential than others, using a parametric Hawkes process model. We
find that tie strength plays an important role: densely embedded social ties
are significantly better conduits of linguistic influence. Geographic locality
appears to play a more limited role: we find relatively little evidence to
support the hypothesis that individuals are more influenced by geographically
local social ties, even in their usage of geographical dialect markers.",2016,http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.02075v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1609.02075v1

subscribe the topics-of-interests over social networks. In this paper, we
formulate the problem of influential users subscription on time-decaying social

the calculation of time-decaying influence over dynamically updating social

modeled using computational methods in network science. Typically,
relationships are represented simply as links, perhaps with weights. The lack
of finer granularity is due in part to the fact that, aside from linkage and
strength, no fundamental or immediately obvious dimensions exist along which to
categorize relationships. Here we propose a set of dimensions that capture
major components of many relationships -- derived both from relevant academic
literature and people's everyday descriptions of their relationships. We first
review prominent findings in sociology and social psychology, highlighting
dimensions that have been widely used to categorize social relationships. Next,
we examine the validity of these dimensions empirically in two crowd-sourced
experiments. Ultimately, we arrive at a set of ten major dimensions that can be
used to categorize relationships: similarity, trust, romance, social support,
identity, respect, knowledge exchange, power, fun, and conflict. These ten
dimensions, while not dispositive, offer higher resolution than existing
models. Indeed, we show that one can more accurately predict missing links in a
social graph by using these dimensions than by using a state-of-the-art link
embeddedness method. We also describe tinghy.org, an online platform we built
to collect data about how social media users perceive their online
relationships, allowing us to examine these dimensions at scale. Overall, by
proposing a new way of modeling social graphs, our work aims to contribute both
to theory in network science and practice in the design of social-networking

internet adoption, researchers increasingly explore smart computing
applications that provide easier access to health and wellness resources.
AI-based systems like chatbots have the potential to provide services that
could provide mental health support. However, existing therapy chatbots are
often retrieval-based, requiring users to respond with a constrained set of
answers, which may not be appropriate given that such pre-determined inquiries
may not reflect each patient's unique circumstances. Generative-based
approaches, such as the OpenAI GPT models, could allow for more dynamic
conversations in therapy chatbot contexts than previous approaches. To
investigate the generative-based model's potential in therapy chatbot contexts,
we built a chatbot using the GPT-2 model. We fine-tuned it with 306 therapy
session transcripts between family caregivers of individuals with dementia and
therapists conducting Problem Solving Therapy. We then evaluated the model's
pre-trained and the fine-tuned model in terms of basic qualities using three
meta-information measurements: the proportion of non-word outputs, the length
of response, and sentiment components. Results showed that: (1) the fine-tuned
model created more non-word outputs than the pre-trained model; (2) the
fine-tuned model generated outputs whose length was more similar to that of the
therapists compared to the pre-trained model; (3) both the pre-trained model

  Negative Emotion Handling in Therapy Chatbots","['Farideh Majidi', 'Marzieh Bahrami']","Emotional well-being significantly influences mental health and overall
quality of life. As therapy chatbots become increasingly prevalent, their
ability to comprehend and respond empathetically to users' emotions remains
limited. This paper addresses this limitation by proposing an approach to
enhance therapy chatbots with auditory perception, enabling them to understand
users' feelings and provide human-like empathy. The proposed method
incorporates speech emotion recognition (SER) techniques using Convolutional
Neural Network (CNN) models and the ShEMO dataset to accurately detect and
classify negative emotions, including anger, fear, and sadness. The SER model
achieves a validation accuracy of 88%, demonstrating its effectiveness in
recognizing emotional states from speech signals. Furthermore, a recommender
system is developed, leveraging the SER model's output to generate personalized
recommendations for managing negative emotions, for which a new bilingual
dataset was generated as well since there is no such dataset available for this
task. The recommender model achieves an accuracy of 98% by employing a
combination of global vectors for word representation (GloVe) and LSTM models.
To provide a more immersive and empathetic user experience, a text-to-speech
model called GlowTTS is integrated, enabling the therapy chatbot to audibly
communicate the generated recommendations to users in both English and Persian.
The proposed approach offers promising potential to enhance therapy chatbots by
providing them with the ability to recognize and respond to users' emotions,

In this work, we designed, implemented, and evaluated a social chatbot capable

adaptive chatbot can dynamically match its self-disclosure to the level of
disclosure exhibited by the users. Our results show that users reciprocate with
higher-level self-disclosure when a recommendation chatbot consistently

social characteristics that cohere with users' expectations, ultimately
avoiding frustration and dissatisfaction. We bring together the literature on
disembodied, text-based chatbots to derive a conceptual model of social
characteristics for chatbots. We analyzed 56 papers from various domains to
understand how social characteristics can benefit human-chatbot interactions
and identify the challenges and strategies to designing them. Additionally, we
discussed how characteristics may influence one another. Our results provide

deployed in many domains to allow people to have a natural interaction while
trying to solve a specific problem. Given their widespread use, it is important
to provide their users with methods and tools to increase users awareness of
various properties of the chatbots, including non-functional properties that
users may consider important in order to trust a specific chatbot. For example,
users may want to use chatbots that are not biased, that do not use abusive
language, that do not leak information to other users, and that respond in a
style which is appropriate for the user's cognitive level.
  In this paper, we address the setting where a chatbot cannot be modified, its
training data cannot be accessed, and yet a neutral party wants to assess and
communicate its trustworthiness to a user, tailored to the user's priorities
over the various trust issues. Such a rating can help users choose among
alternative chatbots, developers test their systems, business leaders price
their offering, and regulators set policies. We envision a personalized rating
methodology for chatbots that relies on separate rating modules for each issue,
and users' detected priority orderings among the relevant trust issues, to
generate an aggregate personalized rating for the trustworthiness of a chatbot.
The method is independent of the specific trust issues and is parametric to the
aggregation procedure, thereby allowing for seamless generalization. We

  for Evaluating Open-domain Chatbot Consistency","['Zekang Li', 'Jinchao Zhang', 'Zhengcong Fei', 'Yang Feng', 'Jie Zhou']","A good open-domain chatbot should avoid presenting contradictory responses
about facts or opinions in a conversational session, known as its consistency
capacity. However, evaluating the consistency capacity of a chatbot is still
challenging. Employing human judges to interact with chatbots on purpose to
check their capacities is costly and low-efficient, and difficult to get rid of
subjective bias. In this paper, we propose the Addressing Inquiries about
History (AIH), an efficient and practical framework for the consistency
evaluation. At the conversation stage, AIH attempts to address appropriate
inquiries about the dialogue history to induce the chatbot to redeclare the
historical facts or opinions. We carry out the conversation between chatbots,
which is more efficient than the human-bot interaction and can also alleviate
the subjective bias. In this way, we manage to rapidly obtain a dialog session
that contains responses with high contradiction possibilities. At the
contradiction recognition stage, we can either employ human judges or a natural
language inference (NLI) model to recognize whether the answers to the
inquiries are contradictory with history. Finally, we are able to rank chatbots
according to the contradiction statistics. Experiments on open-domain chatbots
show that our approach can efficiently and reliably assess the consistency
capacity of chatbots and achieve a high ranking correlation with the human
evaluation. We release the framework and hope to help improve the consistency

treatment, particularly when it comes to building a functioning

considered a promising puzzle piece that helps foster respective information
provision. Several studies have shown that people disclose more information
when they are interacting with a chatbot than when they are interacting with
another human being. If and how the chatbot is embodied, however, seems to play
an important role influencing the extent to which information is disclosed.
Here, research shows that people disclose less if the chatbot is embodied with
a human avatar in comparison to a chatbot without embodiment. Still, there is
only little information available as to whether it is the embodiment with a
human face that inhibits disclosure, or whether any type of face will reduce
the amount of shared information. The study presented in this paper thus aims
to investigate how the type of chatbot embodiment influences self-disclosure in
human-chatbot-interaction. We conducted a quasi-experimental study in which
$n=178$ participants were asked to interact with one of three settings of a
chatbot app. In each setting, the humanness of the chatbot embodiment was
different (i.e., human vs. robot vs. disembodied). A subsequent discourse
analysis explored difference in the breadth and depth of self-disclosure.

the therapies govern the evolution of different cell phenotypes, but the cells'
resistances govern the evolution of the therapies as well. We illustrate the
approach by the minimalistic ad hoc evolutionary model. Its results indicate
that the resistant cells could bias the evolution towards more toxic elementary

to the development of chatbot models, such as ChatGPT, that can engage in
conversational dialogue with human users. However, the ability of these models
to generate toxic or harmful responses during a non-toxic multi-turn
conversation remains an open research question. Existing research focuses on
single-turn sentence testing, while we find that 82\% of the individual
non-toxic sentences that elicit toxic behaviors in a conversation are
considered safe by existing tools. In this paper, we design a new attack,
\toxicbot, by fine-tuning a chatbot to engage in conversation with a target
open-domain chatbot. The chatbot is fine-tuned with a collection of crafted
conversation sequences. Particularly, each conversation begins with a sentence
from a crafted prompt sentences dataset. Our extensive evaluation shows that
open-domain chatbot models can be triggered to generate toxic responses in a
multi-turn conversation. In the best scenario, \toxicbot achieves a 67\%
activation rate. The conversation sequences in the fine-tuning stage help
trigger the toxicity in a conversation, which allows the attack to bypass two
defense methods. Our findings suggest that further research is needed to
address chatbot toxicity in a dynamic interactive environment. The proposed

therapy chatbot,Evaluating Quality of Chatbots and Intelligent Conversational Agents,"['Nicole M. Radziwill', 'Morgan C. Benton']","Chatbots are one class of intelligent, conversational software agents
activated by natural language input (which can be in the form of text, voice,
or both). They provide conversational output in response, and if commanded, can
sometimes also execute tasks. Although chatbot technologies have existed since
the 1960s and have influenced user interface development in games since the
early 1980s, chatbots are now easier to train and implement. This is due to
plentiful open source code, widely available development platforms, and
implementation options via Software as a Service (SaaS). In addition to
enhancing customer experiences and supporting learning, chatbots can also be
used to engineer social harm - that is, to spread rumors and misinformation, or
attack people for posting their thoughts and opinions online. This paper
presents a literature review of quality issues and attributes as they relate to
the contemporary issue of chatbot development and implementation. Finally,
quality assessment approaches are reviewed, and a quality assessment method
based on these attributes and the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) is proposed
and examined.",2017,http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.04579v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1704.04579v1

traction from both academia and industries in recent years. Nowadays, chatbots
are widely used as an agent to communicate with a human in some services such
as booking assistant, customer service, and also a personal partner. The
biggest challenge in building chatbot is to build a humanizing machine to
improve user engagement. Some studies show that emotion is an important aspect
to humanize machine, including chatbot. In this paper, we will provide a
systematic review of approaches in building an emotionally-aware chatbot (EAC).
As far as our knowledge, there is still no work focusing on this area. We
propose three research question regarding EAC studies. We start with the
history and evolution of EAC, then several approaches to build EAC by previous
studies, and some available resources in building EAC. Based on our
investigation, we found that in the early development, EAC exploits a simple
rule-based approach while now most of EAC use neural-based approach. We also
notice that most of EAC contain emotion classifier in their architecture, which
utilize several available affective resources. We also predict that the

  We introduce a classification architecture that outperforms existing work on
churn intent detection in social media. Moreover, we show that, using bilingual
word embeddings, a system trained on combined English and German data
outperforms monolingual approaches. As the only existing dataset is in English,
we crowdsource and publish a novel dataset of German tweets. We thus underline

Patients' questions were placed in ChatGPT with a request for the chatbot to
respond using approximately the same word count as the human provider's
response. In the survey, each patient's question was followed by a provider- or

therapy chatbot,Assistive Chatbots for healthcare: a succinct review,"['Basabdatta Sen Bhattacharya', 'Vibhav Sinai Pissurlenkar']","Artificial Intelligence (AI) for supporting healthcare services has never
been more necessitated than by the recent global pandemic. Here, we review the
state-of-the-art in AI-enabled Chatbots in healthcare proposed during the last
10 years (2013-2023). The focus on AI-enabled technology is because of its
potential for enhancing the quality of human-machine interaction via Chatbots,
reducing dependence on human-human interaction and saving man-hours. Our review
indicates that there are a handful of (commercial) Chatbots that are being used
for patient support, while there are others (non-commercial) that are in the
clinical trial phases. However, there is a lack of trust on this technology
regarding patient safety and data protection, as well as a lack of wider
awareness on its benefits among the healthcare workers and professionals. Also,
patients have expressed dissatisfaction with Natural Language Processing (NLP)
skills of the Chatbots in comparison to humans. Notwithstanding the recent
introduction of ChatGPT that has raised the bar for the NLP technology, this
Chatbot cannot be trusted with patient safety and medical ethics without
thorough and rigorous checks to serve in the `narrow' domain of assistive
healthcare. Our review suggests that to enable deployment and integration of
AI-enabled Chatbots in public health services, the need of the hour is: to
build technology that is simple and safe to use; to build confidence on the
technology among: (a) the medical community by focussed training and
development; (b) the patients and wider community through outreach.",2023,http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.04178v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.04178v1

paper provides a thorough analysis of the chatbot technology environment as it
exists today. It provides a very flexible chatbot system that makes use of
reinforcement learning strategies to improve user interactions and
conversational experiences. Additionally, this system makes use of sentiment
analysis and natural language processing to determine user moods. The chatbot
is a valuable tool across many fields thanks to its amazing characteristics,
which include voice-to-voice conversation, multilingual support [12], advising
skills, offline functioning, and quick help features. The complexity of chatbot
technology development is also explored in this study, along with the causes
that have propelled these developments and their far-reaching effects on a
range of sectors. According to the study, three crucial elements are crucial:
1) Even without explicit profile information, the chatbot system is built to
adeptly understand unique consumer preferences and fluctuating satisfaction
levels. With the use of this capacity, user interactions are made to meet their
wants and preferences. 2) Using a complex method that interlaces Multiview
voice chat information, the chatbot may precisely simulate users' actual
experiences. This aids in developing more genuine and interesting discussions.
3) The study presents an original method for improving the black-box deep
learning models' capacity for prediction. This improvement is made possible by
introducing dynamic satisfaction measurements that are theory-driven, which
leads to more precise forecasts of consumer reaction.",2023,http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08977v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.08977v1

development, with chatbots emerging as a noteworthy addition to this
transformative landscape. As online learning platforms rapidly advance,
students need to adapt swiftly to excel in this dynamic environment.
Consequently, understanding the acceptance of chatbots, particularly those
employing Large Language Model (LLM) such as Chat Generative Pretrained
Transformer (ChatGPT), Google Bard, and other interactive AI technologies, is
of paramount importance. However, existing research on chatbots in education
has overlooked key behavior-related aspects, such as Optimism, Innovativeness,
Discomfort, Insecurity, Transparency, Ethics, Interaction, Engagement, and
Accuracy, creating a significant literature gap. To address this gap, this
study employs Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) to
investigate the determinant of chatbots adoption in education among students,
considering the Technology Readiness Index (TRI) and Technology Acceptance
Model (TAM). Utilizing a five-point Likert scale for data collection, we
gathered a total of 185 responses, which were analyzed using R-Studio software.
We established 12 hypotheses to achieve its objectives. The results showed that
Optimism and Innovativeness are positively associated with Perceived Ease of
Use (PEOU) and Perceived Usefulness (PU). Conversely, Discomfort and Insecurity
negatively impact PEOU, with only Insecurity negatively affecting PU. These
findings provide insights for future technology designers, elucidating critical
user behavior factors influencing chatbots adoption and utilization in

therapy chatbot,Computational model for tumor response to adoptive cell transfer therapy,"['Luciana Melina Luque', 'Carlos Manuel Carlevaro', 'Enrique Rodríguez-Lomba', 'Enrique Lomba']","One of the barriers to the development of effective adoptive cell transfer
therapies (ACT), specifically for genetically engineered T-cell receptors
(TCRs), and chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cells, is target antigen
heterogeneity. It is thought that intratumor heterogeneity is one of the
leading determinants of therapeutic resistance and treatment failure. While
understanding antigen heterogeneity is important for effective therapeutics, a
good therapy strategy could enhance the therapy efficiency. In this work we
introduce an agent-based model to rationalize the outcomes of two types of ACT
therapies over heterogeneous tumors: antigen specific ACT therapy and
multi-antigen recognition ACT therapy. We found that one dose of antigen
specific ACT therapy should be expected to reduce the tumor size as well as its
growth rate, however it may not be enough to completely eliminate it. A second
dose also reduced the tumor size as well as the tumor growth rate, but, due to
the intratumor heterogeneity, it turned out to be less effective than the
previous dose. Moreover, an interesting emergent phenomenon results from the
simulations, namely the formation of a shield-like structure of cells with low
oncoprotein expression. This shield turns out to protect cells with high
oncoprotein expression. On the other hand, our studies suggest that the earlier
the multi-antigen recognition ACT therapy is applied, the more efficient it
turns. In fact, it could completely eliminate the tumor. Based on our results,
it is clear that a proper therapeutic strategy could enhance the therapies
outcomes. In that direction, our computational approach provides a framework to
model treatment combinations in different scenarios and explore the
characteristics of successful and unsuccessful treatments.",2022,http://arxiv.org/abs/2204.05877v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.05877v1

  Software Engineering","['Ahmad Abdellatif', 'Khaled Badran', 'Diego Elias Costa', 'Emad Shihab']","Chatbots are envisioned to dramatically change the future of Software
Engineering, allowing practitioners to chat and inquire about their software
projects and interact with different services using natural language. At the
heart of every chatbot is a Natural Language Understanding (NLU) component that
enables the chatbot to understand natural language input. Recently, many NLU
platforms were provided to serve as an off-the-shelf NLU component for
chatbots, however, selecting the best NLU for Software Engineering chatbots
remains an open challenge.
  Therefore, in this paper, we evaluate four of the most commonly used NLUs,
namely IBM Watson, Google Dialogflow, Rasa, and Microsoft LUIS to shed light on
which NLU should be used in Software Engineering based chatbots. Specifically,
we examine the NLUs' performance in classifying intents, confidence scores
stability, and extracting entities. To evaluate the NLUs, we use two datasets
that reflect two common tasks performed by Software Engineering practitioners,
1) the task of chatting with the chatbot to ask questions about software
repositories 2) the task of asking development questions on Q&A forums (e.g.,
Stack Overflow). According to our findings, IBM Watson is the best performing
NLU when considering the three aspects (intents classification, confidence
scores, and entity extraction). However, the results from each individual
aspect show that, in intents classification, IBM Watson performs the best with
an F1-measure > 84%, but in confidence scores, Rasa comes on top with a median
confidence score higher than 0.91. Our results also show that all NLUs, except
for Dialogflow, generally provide trustable confidence scores. For entity
extraction, Microsoft LUIS and IBM Watson outperform other NLUs in the two SE
tasks. Our results provide guidance to software engineering practitioners when

information to customers about products/services offered by different
companies. Particularly, intent recognition is one of the core components in
the natural language understating capabilities of a chatbot system. Among the
different intents that a chatbot is trained to recognize, there is a set of
them that is universal to any customer service chatbot. Universal intents may
include salutation, switch the conversation to a human agent, farewells, among
others. A system to recognize those universal intents will be very helpful to
optimize the training process of specific customer service chatbots. We propose
the development of a universal intent recognition system, which is trained to
recognize a selected group of 11 intents that are common in 28 different
chatbots. The proposed system is trained considering state-of-the-art
word-embedding models such as word2vec and BERT, and deep classifiers based on
convolutional and recurrent neural networks. The proposed model is able to
discriminate between those universal intents with a balanced accuracy up to
80.4\%. In addition, the proposed system is equally accurate to recognize
intents expressed both in short and long text requests. At the same time,
misclassification errors often occurs between intents with very similar
semantic fields such as farewells and positive comments. The proposed system
will be very helpful to optimize the training process of a customer service
chatbot because some of the intents will be already available and detected by
our system. At the same time, the proposed approach will be a suitable base

  likeness, and social health benefits in machines","['Rose E. Guingrich', 'Michael S. A. Graziano']","As artificial intelligence (AI) becomes more widespread, one question that
arises is how human-AI interaction might impact human-human interaction.
Chatbots, for example, are increasingly used as social companions, and while
much is speculated, little is known empirically about how their use impacts
human relationships. A common hypothesis is that relationships with companion
chatbots are detrimental to social health by harming or replacing human
interaction, but this hypothesis may be too simplistic, especially considering
the social needs of users and the health of their preexisting human
relationships. To understand how relationships with companion chatbots impact
social health, we studied people who regularly used companion chatbots and
people who did not use them. Contrary to expectations, companion chatbot users
indicated that these relationships were beneficial to their social health,
whereas non-users viewed them as harmful. Another common assumption is that
people perceive conscious, humanlike AI as disturbing and threatening. Among
both users and non-users, however, we found the opposite: perceiving companion
chatbots as more conscious and humanlike correlated with more positive opinions
and more pronounced social health benefits. Detailed accounts from users
suggested that these humanlike chatbots may aid social health by supplying
reliable and safe interactions, without necessarily harming human
relationships, but this may depend on users' preexisting social needs and how
they perceive both human likeness and mind in the chatbot.",2023,http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10599v5,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.10599v5

radiotherapy does not. Addressing these deficiencies, however, is not a matter
of technology or understanding, but resources. The future of neutron therapy
lies in better understanding the interaction processes of radiation with living

order to optimize the use of neutron therapy. The questions that need to be
answered are: Can we connect the macroscopic with the microscopic? What is the
optimum energy? What is the optimum energy spectrum? Can we map the sensitivity
of the various tissues of the human body and use that knowledge to our
advantage? And once we gain a better understanding of the above radiobiological
issues will we be able to capitalize on this understanding by precisely and
accurately delivering fast neutrons in a manner comparable to what is now

therapeutic technique, developed over 100 years, and today over 50% of cancer
patients will undergo traditional X-ray radiotherapy. However, ionizing
radiation therapy is not the only option, as the high-energy photons delivering
their cell-killing radiation energy into cancerous tumor can lead to
significant damage to healthy tissues surrounding the tumor, located throughout
the beam's path. Therefore, in nowadays, advances in ionizing radiation therapy
are competitive to non-ionizing ones, as for example the laser light based
therapy, resulting in a synergism that has revolutionized medicine. The use of
non-invasive or minimally invasive (e.g. through flexible endoscopes)
therapeutic procedures in the management of patients represents a very
interesting treatment option. Moreover, as the major breakthrough in cancer
management is the individualized patient treatment, new biophotonic techniques,

individual's ability to communicate effectively. Persons who stutter (PWS)
often suffer considerably under the condition and seek help through therapy.
Fluency shaping is a therapy approach where PWSs learn to modify their speech
to help them to overcome their stutter. Mastering such speech techniques takes
time and practice, even after therapy. Shortly after therapy, success is
evaluated highly, but relapse rates are high. To be able to monitor speech
behavior over a long time, the ability to detect stuttering events and
modifications in speech could help PWSs and speech pathologists to track the
level of fluency. Monitoring could create the ability to intervene early by
detecting lapses in fluency. To the best of our knowledge, no public dataset is

strict adherence to prevent both disease relapse and mutation of drug- and

therapy, host-directed therapy has attracted more attention in recent years as
an adjunct therapy to enhance host immunity to fight against this intractable
pathogen. The goal of this paper is to investigate in-host tuberculosis models
to provide insights into therapy development. Focusing on therapy-targeting

from an established ODE model. Interestingly, the ODE model also demonstrates
that the immune responses can both benefit and impede disease progression,
depending on the number of bacteria engulfed and released by macrophages. We
then develop two It\^{o} SDE models, which consider the impact of demographic
variations at the cellular level and environmental variations during therapies
along with demographic variations. The SDE model with demographic variation
suggests that stochastic fluctuations at the cellular level have significant
influences on (1) the T-cell population in all parameter regions, (2) the
bacterial population when parameters located in the region with multiple
disease outcomes, and (3) the uninfected macrophage population in the parameter
region representing active disease. Further, considering environmental

organize the set of chatbot intents by identifying them using proto-taxonomies,
i.e., meta-knowledge connecting high-level, symbolic concepts shared across
different intents. By using neuro-symbolic algorithms able to incorporate such
proto-taxonomies to expand intent representation, we show that such mined

improvements of more than 10% in the equal error rate (EER) in almost a third

even more relevant in detecting out-of-scope utterances, decreasing the false
acceptance rate (FAR) in more than 20\% in about half of the chatbots. The
experiments demonstrate that such symbolic meta-knowledge structures can be
effectively mined and used by neuro-symbolic algorithms, apparently by

therapy chatbot,Deep Learning Based Chatbot Models,['Richard Csaky'],"A conversational agent (chatbot) is a piece of software that is able to
communicate with humans using natural language. Modeling conversation is an
important task in natural language processing and artificial intelligence.
While chatbots can be used for various tasks, in general they have to
understand users' utterances and provide responses that are relevant to the
problem at hand.
  In my work, I conduct an in-depth survey of recent literature, examining over
70 publications related to chatbots published in the last 3 years. Then, I
proceed to make the argument that the very nature of the general conversation
domain demands approaches that are different from current state-of-of-the-art
architectures. Based on several examples from the literature I show why current
chatbot models fail to take into account enough priors when generating
responses and how this affects the quality of the conversation. In the case of
chatbots, these priors can be outside sources of information that the
conversation is conditioned on like the persona or mood of the conversers. In
addition to presenting the reasons behind this problem, I propose several ideas
on how it could be remedied.
  The next section focuses on adapting the very recent Transformer model to the
chatbot domain, which is currently state-of-the-art in neural machine
translation. I first present experiments with the vanilla model, using
conversations extracted from the Cornell Movie-Dialog Corpus. Secondly, I
augment the model with some of my ideas regarding the issues of encoder-decoder
architectures. More specifically, I feed additional features into the model
like mood or persona together with the raw conversation data. Finally, I
conduct a detailed analysis of how the vanilla model performs on conversational
data by comparing it to previous chatbot models and how the additional features
affect the quality of the generated responses.",2019,http://arxiv.org/abs/1908.08835v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1908.08835v1

facilitate accessible banking and to support customers in making financial
decisions. Chatbots are increasing in prevalence, sometimes even equipped to
mimic human social rules, expectations and norms, decreasing the necessity for
human-to-human interaction. As banks and financial advisory platforms move
towards creating bots that enhance the current state of consumer trust and
adoption rates, we investigated the effects of chatbot vignettes with and
without socio-emotional features on intention to use the chatbot for financial
support purposes. We conducted a between-subject online experiment with N = 410
participants. Participants in the control group were provided with a vignette
describing a secure and reliable chatbot called XRO23, whereas participants in
the experimental group were presented with a vignette describing a secure and
reliable chatbot that is more human-like and named Emma. We found that Vignette
Emma did not increase participants' trust levels nor lowered their privacy
concerns even though it increased perception of social presence. However, we
found that intention to use the presented chatbot for financial support was
positively influenced by perceived humanness and trust in the bot. Participants
were also more willing to share financially-sensitive information such as
account number, sort code and payments information to XRO23 compared to Emma -
revealing a preference for a technical and mechanical FinBot in information
sharing. Overall, this research contributes to our understanding of the
intention to use chatbots with different features as financial technology, in

ability to give correct answers to mathematics and logic problems. In
particular, we check their ability to Understand the problem at hand; Apply
appropriate algorithms or methods for its solution; and Generate a coherent
response and a correct answer. We use 30 questions that are clear, without any
ambiguities, fully described with plain text only, and have a unique, well
defined correct answer. The questions are divided into two sets of 15 each. The
questions of Set A are 15 ""Original"" problems that cannot be found online,
while Set B contains 15 ""Published"" problems that one can find online, usually
with their solution. Each question is posed three times to each chatbot. The
answers are recorded and discussed, highlighting their strengths and
weaknesses. It has been found that for straightforward arithmetic, algebraic
expressions, or basic logic puzzles, chatbots may provide accurate solutions,
although not in every attempt. However, for more complex mathematical problems
or advanced logic tasks, their answers, although written in a usually
""convincing"" way, may not be reliable. Consistency is also an issue, as many
times a chatbot will provide conflicting answers when given the same question
more than once. A comparative quantitative evaluation of the three chatbots is
made through scoring their final answers based on correctness. It was found
that ChatGPT-4 outperforms ChatGPT-3.5 in both sets of questions. Bard comes
third in the original questions of Set A, behind the other two chatbots, while
it has the best performance (first place) in the published questions of Set B.

  Converting Feedback into Principles","['Savvas Petridis', 'Ben Wedin', 'James Wexler', 'Aaron Donsbach', 'Mahima Pushkarna', 'Nitesh Goyal', 'Carrie J. Cai', 'Michael Terry']","Large language model (LLM) prompting is a promising new approach for users to
create and customize their own chatbots. However, current methods for steering
a chatbot's outputs, such as prompt engineering and fine-tuning, do not support
users in converting their natural feedback on the model's outputs to changes in
the prompt or model. In this work, we explore how to enable users to
interactively refine model outputs through their feedback, by helping them
convert their feedback into a set of principles (i.e. a constitution) that
dictate the model's behavior. From a formative study, we (1) found that users
needed support converting their feedback into principles for the chatbot and
(2) classified the different principle types desired by users. Inspired by
these findings, we developed ConstitutionMaker, an interactive tool for
converting user feedback into principles, to steer LLM-based chatbots. With
ConstitutionMaker, users can provide either positive or negative feedback in
natural language, select auto-generated feedback, or rewrite the chatbot's
response; each mode of feedback automatically generates a principle that is
inserted into the chatbot's prompt. In a user study with 14 participants, we
compare ConstitutionMaker to an ablated version, where users write their own
principles. With ConstitutionMaker, participants felt that their principles
could better guide the chatbot, that they could more easily convert their
feedback into principles, and that they could write principles more
efficiently, with less mental demand. ConstitutionMaker helped users identify
ways to improve the chatbot, formulate their intuitive responses to the model
into feedback, and convert this feedback into specific and clear principles.

auditing methodology to investigate how chatbots evaluate true, false, and
borderline statements on five topics: COVID-19, Russian aggression against
Ukraine, the Holocaust, climate change, and LGBTQ+ related debates. We compare
how the chatbots perform in high- and low-resource languages by using prompts
in English, Russian, and Ukrainian. Furthermore, we explore the ability of
chatbots to evaluate statements according to political communication concepts
of disinformation, misinformation, and conspiracy theory, using
definition-oriented prompts. We also systematically test how such evaluations
are influenced by source bias which we model by attributing specific claims to
various political and social actors. The results show high performance of
ChatGPT for the baseline veracity evaluation task, with 72 percent of the cases
evaluated correctly on average across languages without pre-training. Bing Chat
performed worse with a 67 percent accuracy. We observe significant disparities
in how chatbots evaluate prompts in high- and low-resource languages and how
they adapt their evaluations to political communication concepts with ChatGPT
providing more nuanced outputs than Bing Chat. Finally, we find that for some
veracity detection-related tasks, the performance of chatbots varied depending
on the topic of the statement or the source to which it is attributed. These
findings highlight the potential of LLM-based chatbots in tackling different

The mutual interplay between the mechanisms can lead to a synergetic outcome

disorders by polygenic risk scores (PRS).
  SNP-based heritabilities (h2SNP) were significantly larger than zero for most
comparisons. Based on current GWAS data, PRS have mostly modest power to
distinguish between psychiatric disorders. For example, we estimated that AUC
for distinguishing schizophrenia from major depressive disorder (MDD), bipolar

genetically correlated with other psychiatric disorders and heart disease, when

which unifies and links multiple biophysical and behavioral phenomena, in the
sense that diverse biophysical changes can give rise to the same dynamical
phenomena and, vice versa, similar changes in dynamics may yield different
behavioral symptoms depending on the brain area where these changes manifest.

mechanisms rather than subjective symptoms for psychiatric disorders is an
emerging consensus. Recently, machine learning-based classifiers using
functional connectivity (FC) for psychiatric disorders and healthy controls are
developed to identify brain markers. However, existing machine learning-based
diagnostic models are prone to over-fitting (due to insufficient training
samples) and perform poorly in new test environment. Furthermore, it is
difficult to obtain explainable and reliable brain biomarkers elucidating the
underlying diagnostic decisions. These issues hinder their possible clinical
applications. In this work, we propose BrainIB, a new graph neural network
(GNN) framework to analyze functional magnetic resonance images (fMRI), by
leveraging the famed Information Bottleneck (IB) principle. BrainIB is able to
identify the most informative edges in the brain (i.e., subgraph) and
generalizes well to unseen data. We evaluate the performance of BrainIB against
3 baselines and 7 state-of-the-art brain network classification methods on
three psychiatric datasets and observe that our BrainIB always achieves the
highest diagnosis accuracy. It also discovers the subgraph biomarkers which are
consistent to clinical and neuroimaging findings. The source code and

  Strategies for Bipolar Disorder Diagnosis and Treatment",['Trisha Guttal'],"This literature review involves the use of AI communication facilitators to
detect mood disorders such as bipolar disorder, a psychiatric condition in
which patients experience drastic mood shifts. Due to the ill-defined nature of
the disorder, it is difficult for even a psychiatrist alone to be confident
with their diagnosis. Changes in mental and mood state are often highly
subjective and difficult to pinpoint through short-term surveys and psychiatric
consultations. For many patients, diagnosis and treatment based on
trial-and-error is unavoidable. A timely and thorough diagnosis and treatment
plan is associated with the need for an equal involvement of both the patient
and the psychiatrist throughout the process. This conclusion is reached through
a detailed assessment of current interventions for (i) the ill-defined nature
of the disorder, and (ii) the trial-and-error requirement for medication and
diagnosis. As a result, I propose the implementation of an AI communication
facilitator that can aid in the appropriate diagnosis and treatment of bipolar
disorder by embodying the shared decision-making model. I propose that the
model can be broken down into specific critical decision points with
considerations made for each party involved in the process, aligning with the

medicine, which searches for data-driven approaches to improve individual

complicated diagnostic process. However, early diagnosis is vital to control
symptoms. Deep learning has recently become a popular way to analyse and
interpret medical data. Past attempts to use deep learning for schizophrenia
diagnosis from brain-imaging data have shown promise but suffer from a large
training-application gap - it is difficult to apply lab research to the real
world. We propose to reduce this training-application gap by focusing on
readily accessible data. We collect a data set of psychiatric observations of
patients based on DSM-5 criteria. Because similar data is already recorded in
all mental health clinics that diagnose schizophrenia using DSM-5, our method
could be easily integrated into current processes as a tool to assist
clinicians, whilst abiding by formal diagnostic criteria. To facilitate
real-world usage of our system, we show that it is interpretable and robust.
Understanding how a machine learning tool reaches its diagnosis is essential to
allow clinicians to trust that diagnosis. To interpret the framework, we fuse
two complementary attention mechanisms, 'squeeze and excitation' and
'self-attention', to determine global attribute importance and attribute
interactivity, respectively. The model uses these importance scores to make
decisions. This allows clinicians to understand how a diagnosis was reached,
improving trust in the model. Because machine learning models often struggle to
generalise to data from different sources, we perform experiments with
augmented test data to evaluate the model's applicability to the real world. We
find that our model is more robust to perturbations, and should therefore
perform better in a clinical setting. It achieves 98% accuracy with 10-fold

normative approaches have surged as an alternative method. By using a
generative model to learn the distribution of healthy brain data patterns, we
can identify the presence of pathologies as deviations or outliers from the
distribution learned by the model. In particular, deep generative models showed
great results as normative models to identify neurological lesions in the

subtle changes widespread in several brain regions, making these alterations
challenging to identify. In this work, we evaluate the performance of
transformer-based normative models to detect subtle brain changes expressed in

netMoST, to subtyping psychiatric disorders. NetMoST identifies polygenic risk
SNP-allele modules from genome-wide genotyping data as polygenic haplotype
biomarkers (PHBs) for disease subtyping. We applied netMoST to subtype a cohort
of schizophrenia subjects into three distinct biotypes with differentiable
genetic, neuroimaging and functional characteristics. The PHBs of the first
biotype (36.9% of all patients) were related to neurodevelopment and cognition,
the PHBs of the second biotype (28.4%) were enriched for neuroimmune functions,

calcium ions and neurotransmitters. Neuroimaging patterns provided additional
support to the new biotypes, with unique regional homogeneity (ReHo) patterns

is increasingly applied in the diagnosis and pathological research of mental
diseases. Different machine learning algorithms are then developed to exploit
the rich information in rsfMRI and discriminate MDD patients from normal
controls. Despite recent advances reported, the discrimination accuracy has
room for further improvement. The generalizability and interpretability of the
method are not sufficiently addressed either. Here, we propose a machine
learning method (MFMC) for MDD discrimination by concatenating multiple

yields 96.9% MDD discrimination accuracy, demonstrating a significant
improvement over existing methods. In addition, the generalizability of MFMC is
validated by the good performance when the training and testing subjects are
from independent sites. The use of XGBoost as the meta classifier allows us to
probe the decision process of MFMC. We identify 13 feature values related to 9
brain regions including the posterior cingulate gyrus, superior frontal gyrus
orbital part, and angular gyrus, which contribute most to the classification
and also demonstrate significant differences at the group level. The use of
these 13 feature values alone can reach 87% of MFMC's full performance when

of applying CNN to classification of schizophrenia and controls based on

achieved significant progress due to its high precision and reliability.
However, one obstacle to practicality lies in the variability between subjects

approaches to tackle this problem, most of them treat multiple EEG data from
different subjects and sessions together as a single source domain for
transfer, which either fails to satisfy the assumption of domain adaptation
that the source has a certain marginal distribution, or increases the
difficulty of adaptation. We therefore propose the multi-source marginal

domain-invariant and domain-specific features into consideration. First, we
assume that different EEG data share the same low-level features, then we
construct independent branches for multiple EEG data source domains to adopt
one-to-one domain adaptation and extract domain-specific features. Finally, the
inference is made by multiple branches. We evaluate our method on SEED and

cycles of hypomania and depression. Since diagnosing BD relies on subjective
behavioral assessments over a long period, a solid diagnosis based on objective
criteria is not straightforward. The current study responded to the described
obstacle by proposing a hybrid GAN-CNN model to diagnose BD from 3-D structural
MRI Images (sMRI). The novelty of this study stems from diagnosing BD from sMRI
samples rather than conventional datasets such as functional MRI (fMRI),
electroencephalography (EEG), and behavioral symptoms while removing the data
insufficiency usually encountered when dealing with sMRI samples. The impact of
various augmentation ratios is also tested using 5-fold cross-validation. Based
on the results, this study obtains an accuracy rate of 75.8%, a sensitivity of
60.3%, and a specificity of 82.5%, which are 3-5% higher than prior work while
utilizing less than 6% sample counts. Next, it is demonstrated that a 2- D

more straightforward technique than manual image processing. Lastly, the
optimum augmentation threshold for the current study using 172 sMRI samples is
50%, showing the applicability of the described method for larger sMRI

the study is to look for diagnostic signs of subjects' susceptibility to

role of frequency-phase synchronization, a phenomenon representing specific
correlations between the characteristic frequencies and phases of excitations
in the brain. We introduce quantitative measures of frequency-phase
synchronization and systematize the values of FNS parameters for the EEG data.
The comparison of our results with the medical diagnoses for 84 subjects
performed at NCPH makes it possible to group the EEG signals into 4 categories

disorder (OCD) and 12 youth without a psychiatric diagnosis (no-OCD) will be
analyzed. Youth were between 8 and 17 years old. Features from the videos will
be extracted and used to compute ratings of behavior, which will be compared to
ratings of behavior produced by mental health professionals trained to use a
specific behavioral coding manual. We will test the effect of OCD diagnosis on

for the proposed study is that the AI approach will attempt to derive
behavioral ratings based solely on vision, whereas humans use visual,

  Interpretation","['Zhengyuan Yang', 'Amanda Kay', 'Yuncheng Li', 'Wendi Cross', 'Jiebo Luo']","Inspired by the human ability to infer emotions from body language, we
propose an automated framework for body language based emotion recognition
starting from regular RGB videos. In collaboration with psychologists, we
further extend the framework for psychiatric symptom prediction. Because a
specific application domain of the proposed framework may only supply a limited
amount of data, the framework is designed to work on a small training set and
possess a good transferability. The proposed system in the first stage
generates sequences of body language predictions based on human poses estimated
from input videos. In the second stage, the predicted sequences are fed into a
temporal network for emotion interpretation and psychiatric symptom prediction.
We first validate the accuracy and transferability of the proposed body
language recognition method on several public action recognition datasets. We
then evaluate the framework on a proposed URMC dataset, which consists of
conversations between a standardized patient and a behavioral health
professional, along with expert annotations of body language, emotions, and
potential psychiatric symptoms. The proposed framework outperforms other

branch of psychiatry, where clinical experience and several studies suggest
that the relation among the psychiatric disorders may have etiological and
treatment implications. In this paper, we are interested in applying latent
feature modeling to find the latent structure behind the psychiatric disorders
that can help to examine and explain the relationships among them. To this end,
we use the large amount of information collected in the National Epidemiologic
Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions (NESARC) database and propose to model
these data using a nonparametric latent model based on the Indian Buffet
Process (IBP). Due to the discrete nature of the data, we first need to adapt
the observation model for discrete random variables. We propose a generative
model in which the observations are drawn from a multinomial-logit distribution
given the IBP matrix. The implementation of an efficient Gibbs sampler is
accomplished using the Laplace approximation, which allows integrating out the
weighting factors of the multinomial-logit likelihood model. We also provide a
variational inference algorithm for this model, which provides a complementary
(and less expensive in terms of computational complexity) alternative to the
Gibbs sampler allowing us to deal with a larger number of data. Finally, we use
the model to analyze comorbidity among the psychiatric disorders diagnosed by

  classification",['Gagan Sidhu'],"Background:
  Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) provides non-invasive measures
of neuronal activity using an endogenous Blood Oxygenation-Level Dependent
(BOLD) contrast. This article introduces a nonlinear dimensionality reduction
(Locally Linear Embedding) to extract informative measures of the underlying
neuronal activity from BOLD time-series. The method is validated using the
Leave-One-Out-Cross-Validation (LOOCV) accuracy of classifying psychiatric
diagnoses using resting-state and task-related fMRI.
  Methods:
  Locally Linear Embedding of BOLD time-series (into each voxel's respective
tensor) was used to optimise feature selection. This uses Gau\ss' Principle of
Least Constraint to conserve quantities over both space and time. This
conservation was assessed using LOOCV to greedily select time points in an
incremental fashion on training data that was categorised in terms of
psychiatric diagnoses.
  Findings:
  The embedded fMRI gave highly diagnostic performances (> 80%) on eleven
publicly-available datasets containing healthy controls and patients with
either Schizophrenia, Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), or
Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). Furthermore, unlike the original fMRI data
before or after using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for artefact
reduction, the embedded fMRI furnished significantly better than chance
classification (defined as the majority class proportion) on ten of eleven
datasets
  Interpretation:
  Locally Linear Embedding appears to be a useful feature extraction procedure
that retains important information about patterns of brain activity

to increase the quality of life and independence of people with physical,

treatment, inpatient equivalent treatment (IET), is offered since 2018. It
should allow service users with severe mental health issues to stay in their

faults of a system by investigating the observable effects (or symptoms). The
system categorizes the fault into a diagnosis class and identifies a probable
cause based on the supplied fault symptoms. Fault categorization and
identification are done using similarity matching techniques. The development
of diagnosis classes is done by making use of previous experience, knowledge or

  Population Dynamics",['Michael Chary'],"Reward processing and derangements thereof, such as drug addiction, involve
the coordinated activity of many brain areas. Prior work has identified many
behavioral, molecular biological and single neuron changes throughout the
mesocorticolimbic system that reflect and drive addictive behavior.
Subpopulations in the ventral tegemental area (VTA) encode positive reward
prediction error, negative reward prediction error, and the magnitude of the
reward. Phasic activity in VTA dopaminergic neurons correlates with hedonic
value. Tonic activity of groups in the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC)
can encode antidepressant states. However, little is known about how drug
addiction might affect population encoding across larger brain regions. Here,
we compare the information content associated with network patterns in naive,
acutely intoxicated and chronically addicted states in a plastic attractor
network. We found that addiction decreases the network's ability to store and
discriminate among patterns of activity. Altered dopaminergic tone flattens the
energy landscape and decreases the entropy associated with each network
pattern. Altered dmPFC activity produces signal-to-noise deficits similar to
computational models of schizophrenia. Our results provide a conceptual
framework for interpreting altered neural population dynamics in
psychopathological states based on information theory. They also suggest a view
of the subtypes of depression as on a continuum of combinations of cortical and
subcortical dysfunction. This suggests that patients who suffer from depression
with psychotic features will have more cortical than mesolimbic dysfunction.
Furthermore, our framework can be applied to other psychiatric illnesses and so
may help us, in general, quantitatively understand psychiatric illnesses as

  Network Construction","['Zitong Zhang', 'Qawi K. Telesford', 'Chad Giusti', 'Kelvin O. Lim', 'Danielle S. Bassett']","Wavelet methods are widely used to decompose fMRI, EEG, or MEG signals into
time series representing neurophysiological activity in fixed frequency bands.
Using these time series, one can estimate frequency-band specific functional
connectivity between sensors or regions of interest, and thereby construct
functional brain networks that can be examined from a graph theoretic
perspective. Despite their common use, however, practical guidelines for the
choice of wavelet method, filter, and length have remained largely
undelineated. Here, we explicitly explore the effects of wavelet method (MODWT
vs. DWT), wavelet filter (Daubechies Extremal Phase, Daubechies Least
Asymmetric, and Coiflet families), and wavelet length (2 to 24) - each
essential parameters in wavelet-based methods - on the estimated values of
network diagnostics and in their sensitivity to alterations in psychiatric
disease. We observe that the MODWT method produces less variable estimates than
the DWT method. We also observe that the length of the wavelet filter chosen
has a greater impact on the estimated values of network diagnostics than the
type of wavelet chosen. Furthermore, wavelet length impacts the sensitivity of
the method to detect differences between health and disease and tunes
classification accuracy. Collectively, our results suggest that the choice of
wavelet method and length significantly alters the reliability and sensitivity
of these methods in estimating values of network diagnostics drawn from graph
theory. They furthermore demonstrate the importance of reporting the choices
utilized in neuroimaging studies and support the utility of exploring wavelet

psychiatric diagnosis,"How can Deep Learning Retrieve the Write-Missing Additional Diagnosis
  from Chinese Electronic Medical Record For DRG","['Shaohui Liu', 'Xien Liu', 'Ji Wu']","The purpose of write-missing diagnosis detection is to find diseases that
have been clearly diagnosed from medical records but are missed in the
discharge diagnosis. Unlike the definition of missed diagnosis, the
write-missing diagnosis is clearly manifested in the medical record without
further reasoning. The write-missing diagnosis is a common problem, often
caused by physician negligence. The write-missing diagnosis will result in an
incomplete diagnosis of medical records. While under DRG grouping, the
write-missing diagnoses will miss important additional diagnoses (CC, MCC),
thus affecting the correct rate of DRG enrollment.
  Under the circumstance that countries generally start to adopt DRG enrollment
and payment, the problem of write-missing diagnosis is a common and serious
problem. The current manual-based method is expensive due to the complex
content of the full medical record. We think this problem is suitable to be
solved as natural language processing. But to the best of our knowledge, no
researchers have conducted research on this problem based on natural language
processing methods.
  We propose a framework for solving the problem of write-missing diagnosis,
which mainly includes three modules: disease recall module, disease context
logic judgment module, and disease relationship comparison module. Through this
framework, we verify that the problem of write-missing diagnosis can be solved
well, and the results are interpretable. At the same time, we propose advanced
solutions for the disease context logic judgment module and disease
relationship comparison module, which have obvious advantages compared with the
mainstream methods of the same type of problems. Finally, we verified the value
of our proposed framework under DRG medical insurance payment in a tertiary

on the clinical note, plays an essential role in clinical decision-making.
Considering that manual diagnosis could be error-prone and time-consuming, many
intelligent approaches based on clinical text mining have been proposed to
perform automatic diagnosis. However, these methods may not achieve
satisfactory results due to the following challenges. First, most of the
diagnosis codes are rare, and the distribution is extremely unbalanced. Second,
existing methods are challenging to capture the correlation between diagnosis
codes. Third, the lengthy clinical note leads to the excessive dispersion of
key information related to codes. To tackle these challenges, we propose a
novel framework to combine the inheritance-guided hierarchical assignment and
co-occurrence graph propagation for clinical automatic diagnosis. Specifically,
we propose a hierarchical joint prediction strategy to address the challenge of
unbalanced codes distribution. Then, we utilize graph convolutional neural

pelvis, conducts diagnosis, and visualizes results automatically. Deep
convolutional neural networks are trained to provide an end-to-end diagnosis

AVN-net is able to obtain state-of-the-art testing AUC of 0.97 (95% CI:

support clinical decision-making. However, such systems usually need to be
trained on large amounts of annotated data, which often is scarce in the
medical domain. Zero-shot methods address this challenge by allowing a flexible
adaption to new settings with different clinical findings without relying on
labeled data. Further, to integrate automated diagnosis in the clinical
workflow, methods should be transparent and explainable, increasing medical
professionals' trust and facilitating correctness verification. In this work,
we introduce Xplainer, a novel framework for explainable zero-shot diagnosis in
the clinical setting. Xplainer adapts the classification-by-description
approach of contrastive vision-language models to the multi-label medical
diagnosis task. Specifically, instead of directly predicting a diagnosis, we
prompt the model to classify the existence of descriptive observations, which a
radiologist would look for on an X-Ray scan, and use the descriptor
probabilities to estimate the likelihood of a diagnosis. Our model is
explainable by design, as the final diagnosis prediction is directly based on
the prediction of the underlying descriptors. We evaluate Xplainer on two chest
X-ray datasets, CheXpert and ChestX-ray14, and demonstrate its effectiveness in

set of observations and/or measurements that allow to identify the real cause
of a fault. Therefore, diagnosis systems often return many possible candidates,
leaving the burden of selecting the correct diagnosis to a user. Sequential
diagnosis techniques solve this problem by automatically generating a sequence
of queries to some oracle. The answers to these queries provide additional
information necessary to gradually restrict the search space by removing
diagnosis candidates inconsistent with the answers.
  During query computation, existing sequential diagnosis methods often require
the generation of many unnecessary query candidates and strongly rely on
expensive logical reasoners. We tackle this issue by devising efficient
heuristic query search methods. The proposed methods enable for the first time
a completely reasoner-free query generation while at the same time guaranteeing
optimality conditions, e.g. minimal cardinality or best understandability, of
the returned query that existing methods cannot realize. Hence, the performance
of this approach is independent of the (complexity of the) diagnosed system.
Experiments conducted using real-world problems show that the new approach is

physicians and computer-aided diagnosis systems. Mostly, current studies treat
segmentation and diagnosis as independent tasks without considering the

Therefore, it is worth combining them as a whole through exploring the
relationship between thyroid nodule segmentation and diagnosis. According to

communities including artificial intelligence, formal methods, and control.
This has led to a set of disparate approaches addressing different classes of
systems and seeking different forms of diagnoses. In this paper, we resolve
such disparities by generalising Reiter's theory to be agnostic to the types of
systems and diagnoses considered. This more general theory of diagnosis from
first principles defines the minimal diagnosis as the set of preferred
diagnosis candidates in a search space of hypotheses. Computing the minimal
diagnosis is achieved by exploring the space of diagnosis hypotheses, testing
sets of hypotheses for consistency with the system's model and the observation,
and generating conflicts that rule out successors and other portions of the
search space. Under relatively mild assumptions, our algorithms correctly
compute the set of preferred diagnosis candidates. The main difficulty here is
that the search space is no longer a powerset as in Reiter's theory, and that,
as consequence, many of the implicit properties (such as finiteness of the
search space) no longer hold. The notion of conflict also needs to be
generalised and we present such a more general notion. We present two
implementations of these algorithms, using test solvers based on satisfiability
and heuristic search, respectively, which we evaluate on instances from two
real world discrete event problems. Despite the greater generality of our
theory, these implementations surpass the special purpose algorithms designed

individual's behavior, social interactions, symptoms, and other health
conditions, presenting an enormous opportunity for therapeutic advancements and
scientific discoveries regarding the etiology of psychiatric illness.
Continuous collection of mobile data results in the generation of a new type of
data: entangled multivariate time series of outcome, exposure, and covariates.
Missing data is a pervasive problem in biomedical and social science research,
and the Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) using mobile devices in
psychiatric research is no exception. However, the complex structure of
multivariate time series introduces new challenges in handling missing data for
proper causal inference. Data imputation is commonly recommended to enhance
data utility and estimation efficiency. The majority of available imputation
methods are either designed for longitudinal data with limited follow-up times
or for stationary time series, which are incompatible with potentially
non-stationary time series. In the field of psychiatry, non-stationary data are
frequently encountered as symptoms and treatment regimens may experience
dramatic changes over time. To address missing data in possibly non-stationary
multivariate time series, we propose a novel multiple imputation strategy based
on the state space model (SSMmp) and a more computationally efficient variant
(SSMimpute). We demonstrate their advantages over other widely used missing
data strategies by evaluating their theoretical properties and empirical
performance in simulations of both stationary and non-stationary time series,
subject to various missing mechanisms. We apply the SSMimpute to investigate
the association between social network size and negative mood using a
multi-year observational smartphone study of bipolar patients, controlling for

healthcare by enabling better treatment options, improving long-term survival
and quality of life, and reducing overall cost. With the advent of medical big
data, advances in diagnostic tests as well as in machine learning and
statistics, early or timely diagnosis seems within reach. Early diagnosis
research often neglects the potential for optimizing individual diagnostic
paths. To enable personalized early diagnosis, a foundational framework is
needed that delineates the diagnosis process and systematically identifies the
time-dependent value of various diagnostic tests for an individual patient
given their unique characteristics. Here, we propose the first foundational
framework for early and timely diagnosis. It builds on decision-theoretic
approaches to outline the diagnosis process and integrates machine learning and
statistical methodology for estimating the optimal personalized diagnostic
path. To describe the proposed framework as well as possibly other frameworks,
we provide essential definitions.
  The development of a foundational framework is necessary for several reasons:
1) formalism provides clarity for the development of decision support tools; 2)
observed information can be complemented with estimates of the future patient
trajectory; 3) the net benefit of counterfactual diagnostic paths and
associated uncertainties can be modeled for individuals 4) 'early' and 'timely'
diagnosis can be clearly defined; 5) a mechanism emerges for assessing the
value of technologies in terms of their impact on personalized early diagnosis,
resulting health outcomes and incurred costs.
  Finally, we hope that this foundational framework will unlock the
long-awaited potential of timely diagnosis and intervention, leading to
improved outcomes for patients and higher cost-effectiveness for healthcare

ensure proper operation and performance over time. Positron emission tomography
(PET) systems that require regular calibrations by qualified scanner operators
are good candidates for such continuous improvements. Furthermore, for scanners
employing one-to-one coupling of crystals to photodetectors to achieve enhanced
spatial resolution and contrast, the calibration task is even more daunting
because of the large number of independent channels involved. To cope with the
additional complexity of the calibration and quality control procedures of
these scanners, an intelligent system (IS) was designed to perform fault
detection and diagnosis (FDD) of malfunctioning channels. The IS can be broken
down into four hierarchical modules: parameter extraction, channel fault
detection, fault prioritization and diagnosis. Of these modules, the first two
have previously been reported and this paper focuses on fault prioritization
and diagnosis. The purpose of the fault prioritization module is to help the
operator to zero in on the faults that need immediate attention. The fault
diagnosis module will then identify the causes of the malfunction and propose
an explanation of the reasons that lead to the diagnosis. The FDD system was
implemented on a LabPET avalanche photodiode (APD)-based digital PET scanner.
Experiments demonstrated a FDD Sensitivity of 99.3 % (with a 95% confidence

opportunities they offer for advancing medical informatics, there has been
growing interest in mining EHR for improving quality of care. Disease diagnosis
due to its sensitive nature, huge costs of error, and complexity has become an
increasingly important focus of research in past years. Existing studies model
EHR by capturing co-occurrence of clinical events to learn their latent
embeddings. However, relations among clinical events carry various semantics
and contribute differently to disease diagnosis which gives precedence to a
more advanced modeling of heterogeneous data types and relations in EHR data
than existing solutions. To address these issues, we represent how
high-dimensional EHR data and its rich relationships can be suitably translated
into HeteroMed, a heterogeneous information network for robust medical
diagnosis. Our modeling approach allows for straightforward handling of missing
values and heterogeneity of data. HeteroMed exploits metapaths to capture
higher level and semantically important relations contributing to disease
diagnosis. Furthermore, it employs a joint embedding framework to tailor
clinical event representations to the disease diagnosis goal. To the best of
our knowledge, this is the first study to use Heterogeneous Information Network
for modeling clinical data and disease diagnosis. Experimental results of our

psychiatric diagnosis,A Novel Deep Parallel Time-series Relation Network for Fault Diagnosis,['Chun Yang'],"Considering the models that apply the contextual information of time-series
data could improve the fault diagnosis performance, some neural network
structures such as RNN, LSTM, and GRU were proposed to model the fault
diagnosis effectively. However, these models are restricted by their serial
computation and hence cannot achieve high diagnostic efficiency. Also the
parallel CNN is difficult to implement fault diagnosis in an efficient way
because it requires larger convolution kernels or deep structure to achieve
long-term feature extraction capabilities. Besides, BERT model applies absolute
position embedding to introduce contextual information to the model, which
would bring noise to the raw data and therefore cannot be applied to fault
diagnosis directly. In order to address the above problems, a fault diagnosis
model named deep parallel time-series relation network(DPTRN) has been proposed
in this paper. There are mainly three advantages for DPTRN: (1) Our proposed
time relationship unit is based on full multilayer perceptron(MLP) structure,
therefore, DPTRN performs fault diagnosis in a parallel way and improves
computing efficiency significantly. (2) By improving the absolute position
embedding, our novel decoupling position embedding unit could be applied on the
fault diagnosis directly and learn contextual information. (3) Our proposed
DPTRN has obvious advantage in feature interpretability. We confirm the effect
of the proposed method on four datasets, and the results show the
effectiveness, efficiency and interpretability of the proposed DPTRN model.",2021,http://arxiv.org/abs/2112.03405v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.03405v3

methods have been proposed for optic disc and cup (OD/OC) segmentation from the
fundus images. Clinically, OD/OC segmentation is often annotated by multiple
clinical experts to mitigate the personal bias. However, it is hard to train
the automated deep learning models on multiple labels. A common practice to
tackle the issue is majority vote, e.g., taking the average of multiple labels.
However such a strategy ignores the different expertness of medical experts.
Motivated by the observation that OD/OC segmentation is often used for the
glaucoma diagnosis clinically, in this paper, we propose a novel strategy to
fuse the multi-rater OD/OC segmentation labels via the glaucoma diagnosis
performance. Specifically, we assess the expertness of each rater through an
attentive glaucoma diagnosis network. For each rater, its contribution for the
diagnosis will be reflected as an expertness map. To ensure the expertness maps
are general for different glaucoma diagnosis models, we further propose an
Expertness Generator (ExpG) to eliminate the high-frequency components in the
optimization process. Based on the obtained expertness maps, the multi-rater

systems, which aims to estimate learners' current knowledge mastery status and

traditional learning diagnosis methods is the inability to balance diagnostic
accuracy and interpretability. Although the existing psychometric-based
learning diagnosis methods provide some domain interpretation through cognitive
parameters, they have insufficient modeling capability with a shallow structure
for large-scale learning data. While the deep learning-based learning diagnosis
methods have improved the accuracy of learning performance prediction, their
inherent black-box properties lead to a lack of interpretability, making their

ability of deep learning and the interpretability of psychometrics, achieves a
better performance of learning prediction and provides interpretability from
three aspects: cognitive parameters, learner-resource response network, and

coding, leading to unnecessary transmission costs. To mitigate this, we propose
diagnosis-oriented medical image compression, a special semantic compression
task designed for medical scenarios, targeting to reduce the compression cost
without compromising the diagnosis accuracy. However, collecting sufficient
medical data to optimize such a compression system is significantly expensive
and challenging due to privacy issues and the lack of professional annotation.
In this study, we propose DMIC, the first efficient transfer learning-based

effectively optimized with only few-shot annotated medical examples, by reusing
the knowledge in the existing reinforcement learning-based task-driven semantic
coding framework, i.e., HRLVSC [1]. Concretely, we focus on tuning only the
partial parameters of the policy network for bit allocation within HRLVSC,
which enables it to adapt to the medical images. In this work, we validate our
DMIC with the typical medical task, Coronary Artery Segmentation. Extensive

techniques improve, interest grows to apply them in medical applications. To
enable a transition to workflows in a medical context that are aided by machine
learning, the need exists for such algorithms to help justify the obtained
outcome so human clinicians can judge their validity. In this work, deep
learning methods are used to map a frontal X-Ray image to a continuous textual
representation. This textual representation is decoded into a diagnosis and the
associated textual justification that will help a clinician evaluate the
outcome. Additionally, more explanatory data is provided for the diagnosis by
generating a realistic X-Ray that belongs to the nearest alternative diagnosis.
With a clinical expert opinion study on a subset of the X-Ray data set from the
Indiana University hospital network, we demonstrate that our justification
mechanism significantly outperforms existing methods that use saliency maps.
While performing multi-task training with multiple loss functions, our method
achieves excellent diagnosis accuracy and captioning quality when compared to
current state-of-the-art single-task methods.",2019,http://arxiv.org/abs/1907.05671v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.05671v1

specific learning disorder yielded on the validation set a mean area under the
receiver operating characteristics curve of 0.89. This is a novel attempt to

pathological mood swings associated with severe disruptions in emotion

this limitation, we assume that the observations lie in a lower-dimensional

propose a hierarchical model that is computationally feasible, widely
applicable to heterogeneous data and robust to missing instances. Additionally,
the observations' periodic dependencies are captured by non-stationary periodic
covariance functions. The proposed technique is particularly fitted to (and

to afford neuronal activity propagation over long distances while avoiding
runaway excitation. This importance is highlighted by the pathological
consequences and impaired performance resulting from aberrant network
excitability in psychiatric and neurological diseases, such as epilepsy. Theory

interactions can be adequately described by a branching process. This
hypothesis is partially supported by strong evidence for balanced
spatiotemporal dynamics observed in the cerebral cortex, however, evidence of a
causal relationship between network interactions and cortex activity, as

estimating the genetic and environmental covariance functions of functional

from unconstrained estimators can result in large bias. This motivated our
development of a novel estimator ensuring positive semidefiniteness. Simulation
studies demonstrate large improvements over existing approaches, both with
respect to heritability estimates and covariance estimation. We applied the

opportunities in the study of mental health, including the ability to

their primary phone. This phone was loaded with a custom keyboard that
collected metadata consisting of keypress entry time and accelerometer
movement. Individual character data with the exceptions of the backspace key

psychiatric diagnosis,"The Importance of Constraint Smoothness for Parameter Estimation in
  Computational Cognitive Modeling","['Abraham Nunes', 'Alexander Rudiuk']","Psychiatric neuroscience is increasingly aware of the need to define
psychopathology in terms of abnormal neural computation. The central tool in
this endeavour is the fitting of computational models to behavioural data. The
most prominent example of this procedure is fitting reinforcement learning (RL)
models to decision-making data collected from mentally ill and healthy subject
populations. These models are generative models of the decision-making data
themselves, and the parameters we seek to infer can be psychologically and
neurobiologically meaningful. Currently, the gold standard approach to this
inference procedure involves Monte-Carlo sampling, which is robust but
computationally intensive---rendering additional procedures, such as
cross-validation, impractical. Searching for point estimates of model
parameters using optimization procedures remains a popular and interesting
option. On a novel testbed simulating parameter estimation from a common RL
task, we investigated the effects of smooth vs. boundary constraints on
parameter estimation using interior point and deterministic direct search
algorithms for optimization. Ultimately, we show that the use of boundary
constraints can lead to substantial truncation effects. Our results discourage
the use of boundary constraints for these applications.",2018,http://arxiv.org/abs/1803.09018v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.09018v1

Existing linear models seeking to characterize the relation between the
clinical phenotype and the entire edge set in the brain network may be overly
simplistic and often involve inflated number of parameters leading to
computational burden and inaccurate estimation. In one of the first such
efforts, we develop a novel two stage Bayesian framework to find a
node-specific lower dimensional representation for the network using a latent
scale approach in the first stage, and then use a flexible Gaussian process
regression framework for prediction involving the latent scales and other
supplementary covariates in the second stage. The proposed approach relaxes
linearity assumptions, addresses the curse of dimensionality and is scalable to
high dimensional networks while maintaining interpretability at the node level
of the network. Extensive simulations and results from our motivating PTSD

somewhat frequently in texts written by nondiagnosed users in social media.
However, detecting users with these conditions is not a straightforward task as

contextual cues such as immediacy must be taken into account. When available,
linguistic flags pointing to probable anxiety or depression could be used by
medical experts to write better guidelines and treatments. In this paper, we
develop a dataset designed to foster research in depression and anxiety
detection in Twitter, framing the detection task as a binary tweet
classification problem. We then apply state-of-the-art classification models to
this dataset, providing a competitive set of baselines alongside qualitative
error analysis. Our results show that language models perform reasonably well,

implicated in a variety of psychiatric neurodegenerative diseases. The release
dynamics of neurotransmitters is correlated with but distinct from neuronal

neurotransmitter modulation separately from neuron electrical activity. Here,
we present a new approach for imaging deuterated neurotransmitter molecules

perform direct imaging of deuterated dopamine and GABA in PC12 chromaffin

changing the neurotransmitters' chemical identity and requiring custom
synthesis or genetic encoding protocols. We further show that stimulation of
neurotransmitter release results in an overall 20-50 percent intracellular
neurotransmitter signal reduction, in agreement with comparable

present strong evidence that human motor pathways are equally affected by
neuromodulation through noradrenergic and serotonergic projections arising from
the brainstem. To do so, we have identified and collated human experiments
examining the off-label effects of well-characterised serotonergic and
noradrenergic drugs on lab-based electrophysiology measures of
corticospinal-motoneuronal excitability. Specifically, we focus on the effects
that serotonin and noradrenaline associated drugs have on muscle responses to
magnetic or electrical stimulation of the motor cortex and peripheral nerves,

drug effects to a supraspinal or spinal locus. We find that serotonin enhancing
drugs tend to reduce the excitability of the human motor cortex, but that
augmented noradrenergic transmission increases motor cortical excitability by
enhancing measures of intracortical facilitation and reducing inhibition. Both
monoamines tend to enhance the excitability of human motoneurons. Overall, this
work details the importance of neuromodulators for the output of human motor

log-likelihood function and its gradient, whose computational complexity is
linear in the number of events. We extend these methods to a particular form of
a multivariate marked discrete Hawkes process which we use to model the
occurrences of violent events within a forensic psychiatric hospital. A
prominent feature of our problem, captured by a mark in our process, is the
presence of an alarm system which can be heard throughout the hospital. An
alarm is sounded when an event is particularly violent in nature and warrants a
call for assistance from other members of staff. We conduct a detailed analysis
showing that such a variant of the Hawkes process manages to outperform
alternative models in terms of predictive power. Finally, we interpret our

  Time-Varying Treatment Effect Estimation","['Jieru Shi', 'Zhenke Wu', 'Walter Dempsey']","Contextual sensing and delivery of digital interventions to improve health
outcomes have gained significant traction in behavioral and psychiatric
studies. Micro-randomized trials (MRTs) are a common experimental design for
obtaining data-driven evidence on the effectiveness of digital interventions
where each individual is repeatedly randomized to receive treatments over
numerous time points. Throughout the study, individual characteristics and
contextual factors around randomization are collected, with some prespecified
as moderators for assessing time-varying causal effect moderation. However,
many additional measurements beyond these moderators often go underutilized.
Some of these may influence treatment randomization or known to strongly
moderate the treatment effect. Incorporating such auxiliary information into
the estimation procedure can reduce chance imbalances and improve asymptotic
estimation efficiency. In this work, we propose a method to adjust for
auxiliary variables in consistently estimating time-varying intervention
effects. The approach can also be extended to include post-treatment auxiliary
variables when evaluating lagged treatment effects. Under specific conditions,
local efficiency gains are guaranteed. We demonstrate the method's utility
through simulation studies and an analysis of data from the Intern Health Study

  Continuous Attractors","['Huilin Zhao', 'Sungchil Yang', 'Chi Chung Alan Fung']","The N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) is a crucial component of synaptic
transmission, and its dysfunction is implicated in many neurological diseases

(STPP) is a newly discovered postsynaptic response facilitation mechanism. Our
group has suggested that long-lasting glutamate binding of NMDAR allows input
information to be held for up to 500 ms or longer in brain slices, which
contributes to response facilitation. However, the implications of STPP in the
dynamics of neuronal populations remain unknown. In this study, we implemented
STPP in a continuous attractor neural network (CANN) model to describe the
neural information encoded in neuronal populations. Unlike short-term
facilitation, which is a kind of presynaptic plasticity, the temporally
enhanced synaptic efficacy induced by STPP destabilizes the network state of
the CANN by increasing the mobility of the system. This nontrivial dynamical
effect enables a CANN with STPP to track a moving stimulus predictively, i.e.,
the network state responds to the anticipated stimulus. Our findings reveal a
novel STPP-based mechanism for sensory prediction that can help develop

  Diagnosis",['Moshe BenBassat'],"A key step in medical diagnosis is giving the patient a universally
recognized label (e.g. Appendicitis) which essentially assigns the patient to a
class(es) of patients with similar body failures. However, two patients having
the same disease label(s) with high probability may still have differences in
their feature manifestation patterns implying differences in the required
treatments. Additionally, in many cases, the labels of the primary diagnoses
leave some findings unexplained. Medical diagnosis is only partially about
probability calculations for label X or Y. Diagnosis is not complete until the
patient overall situation is clinically understood to the level that enables
the best therapeutic decisions. Most machine learning models are data centric
models, and evidence so far suggest they can reach expert level performance in
the disease labeling phase. Nonetheless, like any other mathematical technique,
they have their limitations and applicability scope. Primarily, data centric
algorithms are knowledge blind and lack anatomy and physiology knowledge that
physicians leverage to achieve complete diagnosis. This article advocates to
complement them with intelligence to overcome their inherent limitations as
knowledge blind algorithms. Machines can learn many things from data, but data
is not the only source that machines can learn from. Historic patient data only
tells us what the possible manifestations of a certain body failure are.
Anatomy and physiology knowledge tell us how the body works and fails. Both are

under a common assumption that the labeled training data (source domain) and

When the distribution changes, most fault diagnosis models need to be rebuilt

expensive or impossible to annotate huge amount of training data to rebuild
such new model. Meanwhile, large amounts of labeled training data have not been
fully utilized yet, which is apparently a waste of resources. As one of the
important research directions of transfer learning, domain adaptation (DA)
typically aims at minimizing the differences between distributions of different

fault diagnosis of rolling bearings under varying working conditions and a
novel diagnosis strategy based on unsupervised DA using subspace alignment (SA)

stacked ensemble classifiers. The first step of our proposed model aims at
early diagnosis based on low-cost features including demographic
characteristics and patient symptoms (including 18 features). TPIS second step

such technologies, users and human experts must be provided with explanations
and insights by the modules. Another issue is related, in most cases, with the
unavailability of labeled historical data that makes the use of supervised
models unfeasible. Therefore, a new approach for fault detection and diagnosis
in rotating machinery is here proposed. The methodology consists of three
parts: feature extraction, fault detection and fault diagnosis. In the first
part, the vibration features in the time and frequency domains are extracted.
Secondly, in the fault detection, the presence of fault is verified in an
unsupervised manner based on anomaly detection algorithms. The modularity of
the methodology allows different algorithms to be implemented. Finally, in
fault diagnosis, Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP), a technique to interpret
black-box models, is used. Through the feature importance ranking obtained by
the model explainability, the fault diagnosis is performed. Two tools for
diagnosis are proposed, namely: unsupervised classification and root cause
analysis. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is shown on three datasets
containing different mechanical faults in rotating machinery. The study also

propose a learning to defer with uncertainty (LDU) algorithm which identifies
patients for whom diagnostic uncertainty is high and defers them for evaluation
by human experts. LDU was evaluated on the diagnosis of myocardial infarction
(using discharge summaries), the diagnosis of any comorbidities (using
structured data), and the diagnosis of pleural effusion and pneumothorax (using
chest x-rays), and compared with 'learning to defer without uncertainty

the same F1 score as LD but deferred considerably fewer patients (e.g. 36% vs.
69% deferral rate for diagnosing pleural effusion with an F1 score of 0.96).
Furthermore, even when many patients were assigned the wrong diagnosis with
high confidence (e.g. for the diagnosis of any comorbidities) LDU achieved a
17% increase in F1 score, whereas DT was not applicable. Importantly, the
weight of the defer loss in LDU can be easily adjusted to obtain the desired
trade-off between diagnostic accuracy and deferral rate. In conclusion, LDU can

However, the low trustworthiness of PHM hinders its applications in
safety-critical assets when handling data from an unknown distribution that

fault diagnosis model flags the OOD dataset with large predictive uncertainty
for expert intervention and is confident in providing predictions for the data
within tolerable uncertainty. This results in trustworthy fault diagnosis and
reduces the risk of erroneous decision-making, thus potentially avoiding
undesirable consequences. The proposed framework is demonstrated by the fault
